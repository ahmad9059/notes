## Deployments & Managing Infrastructure at Scale
---

### CloudFormation Overview

- **What it is:**
   - AWS service for **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.
   - **Declarative** way of describing AWS resources (you state _what_ you want, not _how_ to create it).
   - Supports almost all AWS resources.
- **Example use case:**
   - Define: Security Group, 2 EC2 instances using that SG, an S3 bucket, a Load Balancer.
   - CloudFormation will automatically create all resources in the **correct order** with the exact configuration.

### Benefits of CloudFormation

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - No manual creation of resources.
   - Changes reviewed via **code review** (improves control and governance).
2. **Cost Advantages**
   - Resources in a stack are automatically **tagged** for easier cost tracking.
   - Can **estimate costs** before deployment.
   - Enables **cost-saving automation**, e.g., delete stacks at 5 PM, recreate at 8 AM.
3. **Productivity**
   - Easily **destroy and recreate infrastructure**.
   - Generates **diagrams** of resources and their relationships.
   - Declarative programming: CloudFormation figures out dependencies (e.g., DynamoDB before EC2).
4. **Reusability**
   - Use **existing templates** from AWS docs or community.
   - Almost everything in AWS is supported.
   - If not, use **Custom Resources**.

### Visualization

- **Infrastructure Composer** can visualize stacks.
- Example: WordPress stack diagram shows ALB Listener, DB, Security Groups, Launch Config, etc.
- Helps understand **relations between components**.

### Exam Tips (AWS CCP)

- CloudFormation = **Infrastructure as Code**.
- Used for:
   - **Repeating architectures** across environments (dev, prod).
   - **Deploying to multiple regions or AWS accounts**.
- Remember: Declarative, automated, cost-efficient.


**Key takeaway:** CloudFormation is the **core AWS service for Infrastructure as Code**, making deployments reproducible, scalable, and cost-efficient.



## AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
---

### What is CDK?

- AWS **Cloud Development Kit (CDK)** is a tool to define cloud infrastructure using **familiar programming languages**.
- Alternative to writing raw **CloudFormation templates** (YAML/JSON).
- Supported languages: **Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, .NET**.

### How It Works

1. Write infrastructure code in your chosen language (e.g., Python, TypeScript).
2. CDK **compiles** it into a **CloudFormation template** (JSON or YAML).
3. The template is then deployed via CloudFormation to provision resources.

### Benefits of CDK

- **Infrastructure as Code** but in a **programming language** you already know.
- **Type safety** and familiar constructs.
- Can use **loops, conditionals, reusable functions**.
- Easier and faster to develop compared to raw YAML/JSON.
- Can deploy **infrastructure and runtime code together**.
   - Useful for **Lambda functions**, **ECS/EKS containers**, etc.

### Example Use Case

- Write a CDK app in **Python**:
   - Define a **Lambda function**, **DynamoDB table**, other services.
   - CDK app → compiled into CloudFormation template → deployed.
- Example (TypeScript/JavaScript CDK snippet):
   - Define a **VPC**.
   - Define an **ECS cluster**.
   - Define an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** with a **Fargate service**.
   - CDK compiles this into a CloudFormation template for deployment.

### Exam Tips (AWS CCP)

- CDK is built on top of **CloudFormation**.
- Lets you use **familiar languages** instead of YAML/JSON.
- Still results in a **CloudFormation template** under the hood.
- Best for developers who want:
   - **Reusable code patterns**.
   - **Type safety**.
   - To deploy **infra + app code together**.

![|715x201](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-93.webp)

**Key takeaway:** CDK = CloudFormation, but written in real programming languages, giving you more flexibility, reusability, and speed.



## AWS Elastic Beanstalk
---

### Context and Motivation

- Most **web apps** on AWS follow a **3-tier architecture**:
   - **Load Balancer** (multi-AZ for HA).
   - **EC2 instances** in an **Auto Scaling Group**.
   - **Database** (Amazon RDS).
   - **Optional cache** (ElastiCache for sessions/cached data).
- This can be built manually or via CloudFormation.
- But developers usually **don’t want to manage infrastructure**, they just want to **deploy code** and let AWS handle scaling, load balancing, and provisioning.


![|715x392](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-94.webp)


### What is Elastic Beanstalk?

- **Elastic Beanstalk (EB)** = **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** on AWS.
- Provides a **developer-centric view** for deploying apps.
- Under the hood it still uses:
   - **EC2**, **ASG**, **ELB**, **RDS**, etc.
- **You focus only on application code**.
- AWS handles provisioning, scaling, monitoring, health checks, and deployment strategies.

### Key Features

- **Managed Service** (free to use, pay for underlying resources).
- Handles:
   - EC2 OS setup and configuration.
   - Deployment strategy (configurable).
   - Auto Scaling and Load Balancing.
   - Health monitoring and metrics (via CloudWatch).
- Developer responsibility = **only application code**.

### Beanstalk Architectures

1. **Single instance**
   - Best for **development/test environments**.
2. **Load balanced + Auto Scaling group**
   - Best for **production web apps**.
3. **Worker environments**
   - For **non-web apps** (background jobs, workers).

### Supported Platforms

- Programming languages and runtimes:
   - **Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby**.
- Container support:
   - **Docker (single, multi, preconfigured images)**.
- Many application stacks are supported, making it flexible.

### Health Monitoring

- Beanstalk includes a **health agent** on each EC2 instance.
- Pushes **metrics to CloudWatch**.
- Beanstalk console provides:
   - Application health checks.
   - Monitoring dashboards.
   - Health event logs.

### Cloud Service Models Recap

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** → EC2, RDS, etc.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** → Beanstalk.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** → Services where you only use the software, no infra management (e.g., WorkMail, Chime).

### Exam Tips

- Elastic Beanstalk = **PaaS**.
- Developer responsibility = **only app code**.
- AWS handles infra (provisioning, scaling, monitoring).
- Free to use, but pay for underlying resources.
- Three deployment models: **Single Instance, LB + ASG, Worker**.
- Provides built-in **health monitoring**.



## AWS CodeDeploy

   - **EC2 instances**
   - **On-Premises servers**

### Why CodeDeploy?

- Helps upgrade applications (e.g., **v1 → v2**) seamlessly.
- Works in **hybrid environments**:
   - AWS Cloud (EC2).
   - On-premises data centers.
- Useful for organizations **migrating to AWS**, since it keeps a consistent deployment method.

### Key Features

- **Hybrid deployment service** (EC2 + On-Premises).
- Supports **any type of server**, but:
   - You must **provision servers yourself**.
   - You must install the **CodeDeploy Agent** on those servers.
- Provides a **single interface** to manage deployments across environments.

### Deployment Flow

1. Prepare your servers (EC2 or On-Premises).
2. Install the **CodeDeploy Agent**.
3. Define your application deployment (AppSpec file).
4. CodeDeploy handles **automatic upgrade** from one version to another.


![|715x391](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-95.webp)

### Benefits

- Great for organizations that want **full control of their code inside AWS**.


## AWS CodeBuild
---

### What is CodeBuild?

- **Fully managed build service** on AWS.
- Purpose: **compile source code, run tests, and produce deployment-ready packages**.
- Output = **artifacts** that can be deployed (e.g., by **CodeDeploy**).

### How it Works

1. Developer pushes code → stored in **CodeCommit** (or another repo).
2. **CodeBuild** retrieves code.
3. Runs **build scripts** (defined by you, usually in `buildspec.yml`).
4. Compiles, tests, packages.
5. Produces **artifacts** ready for deployment.

![|715x144](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-96.webp)

### Features

- **Serverless, scalable, pay-as-you-go**.
- Key output = **artifacts ready for deployment**.


## AWS CodePipeline
---

### What is CodePipeline?

- A fully managed **orchestration service** for automating the flow of code changes.
- Connects CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy into a **pipeline**.
- Ensures that code is automatically built, tested, and deployed to production.

### Use Case Example

1. **Developer pushes code** to CodeCommit.
2. **CodeBuild** compiles code and runs tests.
3. **CodeDeploy** (or Elastic Beanstalk) deploys the application to servers.
4. Orchestration is handled by **CodePipeline**.


![|715x194](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-97.webp)
