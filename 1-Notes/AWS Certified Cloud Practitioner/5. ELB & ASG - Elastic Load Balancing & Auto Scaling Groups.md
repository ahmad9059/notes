## Scalability & High Availability
---

### Scalability

**Definition**: Ability of a system to handle greater loads by adapting.

- **Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up/Down)**
   
   - Increase size of instance (t2.micro → t2.large).
   - Example: upgrading a junior operator to senior operator in a call center.
   - Common in non-distributed systems (like databases).
   - Limited by hardware capacity.
- **Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out/In, Elasticity)**
   
   - Add more instances instead of increasing size.
   - Example: adding more operators in a call center.
   - Requires distributed systems.
   - Very common for web applications on AWS.
   - AWS makes this easy with **EC2 + Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**.


### High Availability (HA)

**Definition**: Running application in multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

- Example: Call centers in New York and San Francisco. If one goes down, the other continues.
- Goal: Survive data center loss or disaster (power outage, earthquake, etc).
- Achieved by running instances in **Multi-AZ** with **ASG + Load Balancer**.


### Key AWS Scaling Terms

- **Vertical Scaling** = change instance size (Scale Up/Down).
- **Horizontal Scaling** = change number of instances (Scale Out/In).
- **Elasticity** = Auto Scaling adjusts resources automatically based on demand.
- **Agility** = Not scaling-related. Means new resources can be provisioned quickly (minutes instead of weeks).

### Exam Tips

- **Vertical Scaling** → Bigger/Smaller instance size.
- **Horizontal Scaling** → More/Fewer instances.
- **Elasticity** → Automatic scaling with demand, cost-optimized.
- **High Availability** → Multi-AZ deployment.
- **Agility** → Speed of provisioning IT resources, not scaling.


**Remember**:

- Databases = often vertically scaled.
- Web apps = often horizontally scaled.
- HA(High Availability) = always across multiple AZs.
- Elasticity = scaling automation (pay-per-use).
- Agility = exam distractor in scaling questions.


## Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
---

- A **Load Balancer** is a server that distributes **incoming internet traffic** across multiple **backend servers (EC2 instances)**.
- Ensures no single instance is overwhelmed.
- Provides **scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability**.

![|715x300](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-37.webp)

### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

- A **managed AWS service** for load balancing.
- AWS manages **infrastructure, upgrades, maintenance, and availability**.
- You only configure its **behavior**.
- Replaces the need to manually set up and maintain your own load balancer on EC2.

### Key Features:

1. **Single Access Point** – exposes one DNS hostname for users.
2. **Distributes Traffic** – spreads load across multiple EC2 instances.
3. **Health Checks** – continuously checks instance health, routes only to healthy instances.
4. **Failure Handling** – hides instance failures from users.
5. **SSL Termination** – easily provides HTTPS for applications.
6. **Multi-AZ Support** – works across Availability Zones → increases **high availability**.

### Types of Load Balancers in AWS

#### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- **Layer 7** (Application Layer).
- Supports **HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC**.
- Best for **web apps** with routing needs.
- Features:
   - Advanced routing (host-based, path-based).
   - Good for **microservices, containerized apps**.
   - Provides a **DNS hostname** (not IP).

**Exam keyword**: HTTP/HTTPS → ALB.

#### Network Load Balancer (NLB)

- **Layer 4** (Transport Layer).
- Supports **TCP and UDP**.
- **Ultra-high performance** – millions of requests per second.
- Provides a **static IP address** (via Elastic IPs).
- Use cases:
   - Real-time apps, gaming, IoT, VoIP, financial apps.
   - Where you need **low latency** and **static IP**.

**Exam keyword**: TCP/UDP, millions of req/sec, static IP → NLB.

#### Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

- **Layer 3** (Network Layer).
- Uses **GENEVE protocol**.
- Routes traffic to **third-party security appliances** on EC2:
   - Firewalls
   - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
   - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
- Balances load **not for applications**, but for **security appliances**.

**Exam keyword**: Firewalls, packet inspection → GWLB.

#### Classic Load Balancer (CLB) [Legacy]

- Supported both **Layer 4 and Layer 7**.
- Older generation, being **retired**.
- Replaced by **ALB** and **NLB**.
- Not likely on the exam anymore.

### ELB Exam Summary

- **ALB** → Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS, advanced routing.
- **NLB** → Layer 4, TCP/UDP, high performance, static IP.
- **GWLB** → Layer 3, GENEVE, for security appliances.
- **CLB** → Old, replaced by ALB & NLB.


**Note:** If you see keywords in the exam:

- **HTTP/HTTPS/gRPC** → ALB.
- **Millions of requests, TCP/UDP, static IP** → NLB.
- **Firewall, packet inspection** → GWLB.


## AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) with EC2 – Notes
---

###  Launch EC2 Instances

- Launch **2 EC2 instances** using Amazon Linux 2.
- Instance type: **t2.micro**.
- **No key pair** (EC2 Instance Connect can be used if needed).
- Security group: use **Launch Wizard 1** (allows HTTP + SSH).
- Add **User Data script** (to auto-configure and serve a "Hello World" page).
- Result: Both instances return **Hello World** when accessed by IPv4.

### Load Balancer Types

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
   - Works at **Layer 7** (HTTP/HTTPS).
   - Best for web applications, path-based routing, host-based routing.
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB):**
   - Works at **Layer 4** (TCP, UDP, TLS).
   - Handles **millions of requests per second** with **ultra-low latency**.
- **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):**
   - Used for **security appliances** (IDS, IPS, firewalls).
   - Analyzes and inspects network traffic.
- **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Deprecated, being phased out.

### Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- Name: **DemoALB**.
- Scheme: **Internet-facing**, IPv4.
- Deploy across **multiple Availability Zones**.

### Security Group for ALB

- Create new SG: **demo-sg-load-balancer**.
- Inbound: Allow **HTTP (port 80)** from anywhere.
- Outbound: Default (all allowed).

### Listeners & Target Group

- **Listener:** Port 80 (HTTP).
- **Target Group:**
   - Name: **demo-tg-alb**.
   - Target type: **Instances**.
   - Protocol: HTTP, Port: 80.
   - Health checks enabled (default).
   - Register both EC2 instances.

### Test Load Balancer

- ALB provides a **DNS name** (e.g., `DemoALB-123456.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).
- Access via browser → returns "Hello World".
- Refreshing the page alternates between both instances.
- **Proof of load balancing:**
   - Requests are distributed across both healthy targets.


## AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
---

- Website traffic/load changes over time.
   - Example: More users during the day, fewer at night.
- Cloud allows us to **add/remove servers quickly**.
- **ASG automatically adjusts capacity**:
   - **Scale Out** = Add EC2 instances when demand increases.
   - **Scale In** = Remove EC2 instances when demand decreases.

### Benefits of Auto Scaling Groups

- Maintain **Minimum** and **Maximum** number of instances.
- Instances automatically:
   - **Registered/Deregistered** with Load Balancer.
   - **Replaced if unhealthy** (terminated and relaunched).
- **Cost savings**: only pay for optimal capacity.
- Supports **elasticity**, a core AWS principle.

### Key ASG Settings

- **Minimum Size** = The fewest EC2 instances running (e.g., 1).
- **Desired Capacity** = The actual target number of instances.
- **Maximum Size** = The most EC2 instances allowed.
- ASG scales **between min and max** automatically.

![|715x298](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-40.webp)
### ASG + Load Balancer Integration

- Web traffic first goes to the **Load Balancer (LB)**.
- LB forwards traffic only to **healthy instances** in the ASG.
- When ASG scales out → New EC2 instances are **added to LB target group**.
- When ASG scales in → EC2 instances are **deregistered** and removed.
- Ensures even traffic distribution and resilience.

## 5. Example Flow

1. Start with **1 EC2 instance** (minimum).
2. Traffic increases → ASG launches more EC2s.
3. LB automatically includes them in rotation.
4. Traffic decreases → ASG terminates extra EC2s.
5. LB stops sending traffic to terminated instances.

![|715x300](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-39.webp)

 **Key Takeaways for Exam**

- **Elasticity** = scaling with demand (cost-efficient).
- **HA (High Availability)** = ASG across multiple AZs + LB.
- **Self-healing** = unhealthy instances replaced automatically.
- **Cost optimization** = never run more than needed.


## Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Hands-On
---

### Create an Auto Scaling Group

- Go to **Auto Scaling Groups** in the EC2 console.
- Create new ASG → name it, e.g. `DemoASG`.

### Launch Template

- Create a **Launch Template** (required for ASG).
   - Example name: `DemoLaunchTemplate`.
   - Defines how EC2 instances will be created (AMI, instance type, security groups, etc.).
   - Similar setup to launching EC2 manually.
   - Example settings:
       - **AMI**: Amazon Linux 2
       - **Instance Type**: `t2.micro`
       - **Key Pair**: optional (can omit)
       - **Security Group**: select existing, e.g. `launch-wizard-1`
       - **Storage (EBS)**: default
       - **User Data**: add script if needed

### Configure ASG

- **Instance type**: inherits from launch template (e.g. `t2.micro`).
- **VPC & Subnets**: select multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
- **AZ Distribution**: use "balanced best effort" (default).

### Load Balancing & Health Checks

- Attach ASG to an **existing Load Balancer** (e.g. `demo-tg-alb`).
- Turn on **ELB Health Checks** in addition to EC2 health checks.
    - Ensures unhealthy instances are replaced automatically.

### Group Size & Scaling

- Define **Desired, Minimum, and Maximum Capacity**:
   - Example: Desired = 2, Min = 1, Max = 4.
- Auto scaling policies can be added later.

### Additional Settings

- Instance maintenance policy → keep default (No Policy).
- Additional capacity settings → default.
- Notifications, tags → optional.

### Creation

- Review configuration.
- Click **Create Auto Scaling Group**.

### Verification

- ASG will launch instances to match desired capacity.
- Check under **Activity** tab → see new EC2 instances launching.
- Check **Instance Management** → instances in pending/running state.
- Check **Target Group** → new instances appear as targets.

### Health Check Optimization

- To speed up instance health checks:
   - Healthy threshold = 2
   - Interval = 5 sec
   - Timeout = 2 sec
- Saves time waiting for “unhealthy → healthy” status.

### Testing

- Once healthy, go to **Load Balancer DNS name**.
- Should return `Hello World` from the EC2 instances created by the ASG.

**Key Benefit**: The Auto Scaling Group automatically manages EC2 instances, integrates with the Load Balancer, and ensures high availability with health checks.


## Auto Scaling Group (ASG) – Scaling Strategies
---

### 1. Manual Scaling

- Update ASG size **manually**.
- Example: Change capacity from **1 → 2 instances**, or back down.

### 2. Dynamic Scaling

Automatically responds to **changing demand** using **CloudWatch alarms**.

- **Simple Scaling**
   - Define one CloudWatch alarm → trigger one scaling action.
   - Example:
       - CPU > 70% for 5 min → add 2 instances.
       - CPU < 30% for 10 min → remove 1 instance.
- **Step Scaling**
    - Similar to simple scaling, but allows **different actions for different thresholds**.
    - Example:
        - CPU > 70% → add 2 instances.
        - CPU > 90% → add 4 instances.

### 3. Target Tracking Scaling

- Easiest option.
- Define a **target metric**, ASG scales automatically to stay around that value.
- Example:
   - Keep **average CPU = 40%**.
   - ASG adds/removes instances to maintain ~40%.

### 4. Scheduled Scaling

- Scale based on a **known future event or pattern**.
- Example:
   - On **Friday at 5 PM**, increase minimum capacity to **10 instances** before a big traffic surge (e.g., sports betting site).

### 5. Predictive Scaling

- Uses **Machine Learning** to analyze past traffic patterns.
- Forecasts future demand and provisions instances **ahead of time**.
- Example:
   - Traffic spikes daily from **6–9 PM** → ASG launches extra instances before that window.

![|715x365](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-41.webp)

**Exam Tip**:

- **Manual Scaling** = human intervention.
- **Dynamic Scaling (Simple/Step)** = CloudWatch alarms + rules.
- **Target Tracking** = maintain a metric (like thermostat).
- **Scheduled Scaling** = predictable time-based scaling.
- **Predictive Scaling** = ML-based traffic forecasting.
