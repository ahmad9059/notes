## IAM (Identity and Access Management)
---

### What is IAM?

- **IAM = Identity and Access Management**.
- A **global service** in AWS (not region-specific).
- Used to manage **users, groups, and permissions**.

### Root User

- Created by default when you make an AWS account.
- Has **full access** to everything.
- Should only be used for **initial setup**, not daily tasks.
- Best practice: never share or use root account for normal work.


### Users and Groups

- **User** = one person in your organization.
- **Groups** = logical collection of users.
- Groups can **only contain users** (not other groups).
- A user can:
   - Belong to **no group** (not recommended).
   - Belong to **multiple groups**.
- Example:
   - Developers group: Alice, Bob, Charles.
   - Operations group: David, Edward.
   - Charles + David also in Audit group.

### Permissions via Policies

- Users or groups are assigned **IAM Policies**.
- Policy = JSON document that defines **what actions** are allowed on **which resources**.
- Policies are **not programming**, they’re descriptive rules.
- Example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
        "cloudwatch:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Best Practices

- Apply the **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Only grant the minimum permissions needed.
   - Avoid giving full access to all users.
- Prevents misuse, high costs, and security risks.



## IAM User Creation (Hands-on)
---
### IAM is Global

- No region selection for IAM, users are available everywhere.

### Why Create IAM Users?
- Root account = full access, risky for daily use.
- Best practice → create **admin IAM user(s)** instead of using root.

### Steps to Create a User
1. Go to **IAM → Users → Add User**.
2. Give username (e.g., `Stephane`).
3. Enable console access with a password:
   - Auto-generate for others (force password change).
   - Custom password for yourself.
1. Assign permissions via a **group**:
   - Create `admin` group → attach **AdministratorAccess** policy.
   - Add user to this group.
1. (Optional) Add **tags** like department.
2. Review → create user → download CSV or email login details.

### Group Permissions
- Users inherit permissions from their groups.
- Easier than attaching policies directly to each user.

### Sign-In URL & Alias
- Each AWS account has a **sign-in URL**.
- Can customize with an **account alias** for simplicity.

### Using IAM User
- Log in with IAM user credentials via sign-in URL.
- Use private/incognito window if you want **root and IAM sessions simultaneously**.
- Top-right corner shows if logged in as **root** (account ID only) or **IAM user** (ID + username).

### Best Practice
- Always use **IAM user** for daily work.
- Keep root credentials safe and rarely used.

## IAM Policies
---

### Policy Assignment

- Policies can be attached at:
   - **Group level** → applies to all members (e.g., Developers group → Alice, Bob, Charles).
   - **User level (inline policies)** → applied directly to one user.
   - **Multiple groups** → a user can inherit policies from several groups.

**Example:**
- Charles (Developer + Audit group) = policies from both groups.
- David (Operations + Audit group) = policies from both groups.

![|715x397](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-9.webp)

### Policy Structure (JSON format)

IAM policies are written in JSON and have these main parts:
- **Version** → policy language version (commonly `2012-10-17`).
- **Id** → optional identifier for the policy.
- **Statement(s)** → one or more rules, each with:
   - **Sid** → optional statement ID.
   - **Effect** → `Allow` or `Deny`.
   - **Principal** → account/user/role the policy applies to.
   - **Action** → API actions affected (e.g., `s3:GetObject`).
   - **Resource** → resource(s) the actions apply to (e.g., S3 bucket, EC2 instance).
   - **Condition** → optional, specifies when the policy applies.

## IAM Security: Password Policies & MFA
---

### Why Secure Users and Groups?

- To prevent accounts from being **compromised**.
- Two main defense mechanisms:
   1. **Password Policies**
   2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

### Password Policy in AWS

- **Purpose**: Stronger passwords = stronger security.
- **Options you can configure**:
   - Minimum **password length**.
   - Require specific **character types**:
      - Uppercase letters
      - Lowercase letters
      - Numbers
      - Non-alphanumeric (e.g., `?`, `!`)
   - Allow or deny users to **change their own passwords**.
   - **Expire passwords** after a set period (e.g., every 90 days).
   - **Prevent password reuse** (users cannot set a previous password again).
   
➡️ Helps protect against **brute force attacks**.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Definition**: Extra security layer requiring:
   - Something you **know** (password)
   - Something you **have** (security device)
- Strongly recommended for:
   - **Root account** (mandatory)
   - All IAM users

**Example:**
- Alice has a password **+** MFA token.
- Even if her password is stolen, her account is still safe without the device.


### MFA Device Options in AWS

1. **Virtual MFA Device** (most common)
   - Apps: **Google Authenticator**, **Authy**.
   - Multiple accounts/users supported (Authy makes it easier).
2. **U2F Security Key** (physical device)
   - Example: **YubiKey** by Yubico (third-party).
   - One key supports multiple users (root + IAM).
1. **Hardware Key Fob MFA Device**
   - Example: Provided by **Gemalto** (third-party).
4. **GovCloud Special MFA**
   - For **AWS GovCloud (US)** users only.
   - Provided by **SurePassID** (third-party).


## Password Policy in AWS IAM
---

- Found under **Account Settings → Password Policy**.
- Options:
   - Use default IAM password policy.
   - Or **customize policy**:
      - Minimum password length.
      - Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters.
      - Enable **password expiration** (e.g., 90 days).
      - Decide if **users can change their own password**.
      - Prevent **password reuse**.
- All this is editable directly in the **IAM console**.
- This is the **first layer of account security**.


### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account

- Root account = most important AWS account.
- Setup MFA:
   1. Add MFA device.
   2. Types of MFA:
     - **Authenticator app** (e.g., Google Authenticator, Twilio Authy).
     - **Security key** (e.g., YubiKey).
     - **Hardware TOTP token**.
- Example shown: using an **Authenticator App**.
   - Scan AWS QR code with the app.
   - App generates **rotating codes**.
   - Enter **two consecutive codes** in AWS to confirm setup.
- Up to **8 MFA devices** can be added.
- After setup:
   - On login, AWS asks for **MFA code** after password.
   - Adds an **extra security layer**.

Warning: If you lose your MFA device, you might be locked out. Best to be careful.


## 3 Ways to Access AWS
---

### AWS Management Console

- Web interface (what we’ve been using so far).
- Secured by:
   - **Username + Password**
   - Possibly **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**.


### AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)

- Tool installed on your **computer/terminal**.
- Secured by **Access Keys**:
   - **Access Key ID** = like username.
   - **Secret Access Key** = like password.
   - Do **not share** keys; each user can generate their own.
- Generated in the **Management Console → Create Access Keys**.
- Keys must be downloaded immediately after creation.
- CLI allows you to:
   - Interact with **AWS APIs directly**.
   - Run commands, e.g., `aws s3 cp ...`.
   - Write **scripts to automate tasks**.
- CLI is **open-source** (code on GitHub).
- Some people use only CLI, never the console.

### AWS SDK (Software Development Kit)

- A **language-specific library** for embedding AWS into your code.
- Allows apps to **programmatically call AWS APIs**.
- Supports many languages:
   - JavaScript, Python (Boto3), Java, Go, PHP, Ruby, .NET, C++, Node.js.
   - Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS).
   - IoT SDKs (for connected devices like sensors, locks, etc).
- Example: The **AWS CLI itself is built** on the AWS SDK for Python (**Boto**).

### Key Security Point

- **Access Keys = very sensitive** (like password).
- Treat **Access Key ID like username**, **Secret Access Key like password**.
- Never share with colleagues; they can create their own.


## Installing AWS CLI on Linux
---


There are two common ways to install AWS CLI on Linux:

### Method 1: Official AWS CLI v2 Installer

This works on most Linux distributions.
1. **Download the installer (zip file):**

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
```

2. **Unzip the installer:**

```bash
unzip awscliv2.zip
```

3. **Run the installer as root:**

```bash
sudo ./aws/install
```

4. **Verify the installation:**

```bash
aws --version
```

You should see something like:

```bash
aws-cli/2.x.x Python/3.x Linux/x86_64 botocore/2.x.x
```


### Method 2: Arch Linux (Pacman)

On **Arch Linux**, you can directly install it with `pacman`:

```bash
sudo pacman -S aws-cli
```

This installs the latest packaged version from the Arch repositories.

Verify installation:

```bash
aws --version
```


## AWS CloudShell
---

- A browser-based shell that lets you run AWS CLI commands without local setup.
- Accessible from the AWS Management Console (top-right icon).
- Free to use.

### Availability

- Not available in all AWS regions.
- To use it, select a region where CloudShell is supported.


### Features

1. **Pre-installed AWS CLI**
   - AWS CLI v2 is already installed and ready to use.
   - Credentials are automatically provided (no need to configure `aws configure`).
   - Default region is the same as the console region you are logged into.
1. **File Persistence**
   - Files created in CloudShell persist across sessions.
   - Example: `echo "test" > demo.txt` → the file remains after restarting CloudShell.
1. **Customization**
   - Can adjust font size (small, medium, large).
   - Can switch between light/dark theme.
   - Option for safe paste.
1. **File Management**
   - Download files from CloudShell to your computer.
   - Upload files into CloudShell for use.
1. **Multi-Tab & Splits**
   - Open multiple tabs.
   - Split the screen into columns for running parallel sessions.

### Usage

- Run AWS CLI commands just like in your local terminal.
- Example: `aws iam list-users` → returns API results using your AWS account credentials.
- Works the same as the terminal you configured earlier, but managed in the cloud.


## IAM Roles
---

- IAM Roles are like **users** but not meant for people.
- They are designed for **AWS services** to perform actions on your behalf.
- Roles contain **permissions policies** that define what actions the service can perform.

### Why Roles?

- Some AWS services need permissions to access other AWS resources.
- Instead of assigning long-term credentials, you attach an IAM Role.
- This allows secure, temporary access.

**Example**: 

**EC2 Instance + IAM Role**:
- EC2 needs to read data from S3.
- You attach an IAM Role to the EC2 instance.
- The role has the necessary permissions (e.g., S3 read).
- EC2 uses the role automatically when making requests.



![|417x459](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-11.webp)


### Common IAM Roles

- **EC2 Instance Role** – Grants permissions for EC2 instances.
- **Lambda Function Role** – Allows Lambda functions to access AWS resources.
- **CloudFormation Role** – Grants permissions for CloudFormation to create/manage resources.


### Key Points

- Roles = **permissions for AWS services** (not users).
- Services assume the role to get temporary credentials.
- IAM Roles are central for secure automation and service-to-service communication.


## IAM Security Tools
---

### IAM Credentials Report (Account-level)

- A report generated at the **account level**.
- Contains all IAM users in the account.
- Shows the **status of their credentials** (passwords, access keys, MFA, etc).
- Useful for auditing security at a high level.

![|147x156](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-12.webp)



### IAM Access Advisor/Last Accessed (User-level)

- Available at the **individual user level**.
- Shows:
   - **Which services** the user has permissions for.
   - **When those services were last accessed**.
- Helps apply the **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Identify unused permissions.
   - Remove unnecessary access.

![|468x234](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-13.webp)

### Key Takeaways

- **Credentials Report** = Audit all users’ credentials in the account.
- **Access Advisor** = Review a single user’s service usage.
- Together, they improve **security and compliance**.


## IAM Best Practices
---

### 1. Root Account

- ❌ Do not use the **root account**, except for **initial setup**.
- You should now have:
  - **Root account** (for emergencies and setup)
  - **Your own personal IAM user account**

### 2. Users and Groups

- **One AWS user = one physical person**.
   - If a friend/colleague needs AWS access → **create a separate IAM user** for them.
- Use **groups** to manage permissions collectively.
- Apply permissions at the **group level** (not individual users).

### 3. Security Best Practices

- Create and enforce a **strong password policy**.
- Enable **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for stronger security.

### 4. Roles and Permissions

- Use **IAM Roles** to grant permissions to **AWS services**.
   - Example: EC2 instances should use roles to access other AWS services.

### 5. Programmatic Access

- When using AWS **CLI or SDKs**, you need **Access Keys**.
- Access keys = **like passwords** → keep them **secret** and **do not share**.

### 6. Managing and Auditing Access

- Use:
   - **IAM Credential Reports** – overview of all IAM users and their credentials.
   - **IAM Access Advisor** – shows permissions actually used by users.

### 7. Golden Rule 🚨

- ❌ Never share IAM user credentials or access keys.


## Shared Responsibility Model – IAM Context
---

### Exam Relevance

- ❗ Expect **many questions** on the **Shared Responsibility Model** in the AWS CCP exam.
- Goal: Know what **AWS is responsible for** vs. what **you are responsible for**.


### AWS Responsibilities

AWS handles everything about the infrastructure:

- **Global infrastructure security** (data centers, hardware, networking).
- **Configuration and vulnerability management** of AWS-managed services.
- **Compliance** (certifications, audits, etc.).

### Customer (Your) Responsibilities

You must secure how you use AWS services:

- **Identity & Access Management (IAM):**
   - Create and manage **users, groups, roles, and policies**.
   - Manage and monitor those permissions.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - Enable and enforce MFA on accounts.
- **Access Keys:**
   - Rotate keys regularly.
   - Protect them from exposure.
- **Permissions Management:**
   - Apply least-privilege policies.
   - Use IAM tools (Access Advisor, Credential Reports).
- **Monitoring & Auditing:**
   - Analyze access patterns.
   - Review and adjust permissions periodically.

### Core Principle

- **AWS:** Secures the infrastructure.
- **You (the customer):** Secure **how** you use that infrastructure.
