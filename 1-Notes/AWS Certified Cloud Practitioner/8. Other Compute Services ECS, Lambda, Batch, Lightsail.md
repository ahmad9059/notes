## Docker Introduction (Before ECS)
---

### What is Docker?

- Docker = software development platform to **deploy applications**.
- Traditional way: install apps directly on Linux → works but not portable.
- Docker way: package app into **containers**.

### Docker Containers

- Run **the same way everywhere** (no compatibility issues).
- Works with **any programming language, OS, technology**.
- Easier to maintain, deploy, and scale.
- Scaling containers = **seconds**.
- Powerful and widely used for modern app deployment.

### Docker on EC2

- You can run multiple containers on the same EC2 instance:
   - Example: Java, Node.js, MySQL all on one EC2.
- **Docker Images** = blueprint for containers.
- Stored in **Docker Repositories**.

### Docker Repositories

- **Public**: Docker Hub (base images for OS, DBs, languages).
- **Private**: Amazon **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** for private images.

### Docker vs Virtual Machines

- Docker ≠ full virtualization.
- **VM approach**:
   - Infrastructure → Host OS → Hypervisor → Guest OS → Apps.
   - Each VM has its own OS → heavier.
- **Docker approach**:
   - Infrastructure → Host OS (EC2) → Docker Daemon → Containers.
   - Containers share resources with host.
   - **Lightweight, faster, easier to scale.**

### Exam Tip

- **You don’t need deep Docker knowledge for CCP**.
- Just know:
   - Docker = containerization.
   - Images stored in repos (Docker Hub, ECR).
   - Lighter than VMs.
   - ECS = AWS service to run/manage Docker containers.


## ECS, Fargate, and ECR (AWS CCP)
---

### ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- Used to **launch Docker containers** on AWS.
- Requires **provisioning & managing EC2 instances** yourself.
- AWS manages container lifecycle (start/stop).
- Can integrate with **Application Load Balancer**.
- ECS decides which EC2 instance will host each container.
- **Exam Tip**: “Run Docker containers on AWS → think ECS.”

![|475x502](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-83.webp)

### Fargate

- Also runs Docker containers on AWS.
- **No need to manage EC2 instances** (serverless).
- You only define **CPU and RAM** per container.
- AWS runs containers automatically (location abstracted).
- **Simpler than ECS**, preferred for ease of use.
- **Exam Tip**: Fargate = serverless container solution.


![|489x384](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-84.webp)

### ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

- Private AWS Docker image registry.
- Stores **Docker images** for ECS and Fargate.
- Alternative to public repos (like Docker Hub).


![|715x439](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-85.webp)

### Comparison

- **ECS** → Run containers, manage EC2 infra yourself.
- **Fargate** → Run containers, AWS manages infra (serverless).
- **ECR** → Store Docker images for ECS/Fargate.

**Exam Key Point**: Know the difference between ECS, Fargate, and ECR.



## Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
---

### What is EKS?

- **Elastic Kubernetes Service** (managed service for Kubernetes on AWS).
- Allows you to **launch & manage Kubernetes clusters**.

### Kubernetes Recap

- Open-source system for:
   - **Managing**
   - **Deploying**
   - **Scaling** containerized apps.
- Typically uses **Docker containers**, but supports other container runtimes too.
- Runs workloads in **Pods** (smallest deployable units).

### Where Pods Run in EKS

- **On EC2 instances** → You manage infra.
- **On AWS Fargate** → Fully serverless, AWS manages infra.

### Why EKS?

- Running Kubernetes yourself = complex.
- **EKS provides a managed Kubernetes control plane**.
- Great for **multi-cloud** or **hybrid** setups → Kubernetes is **cloud agnostic**.
   - Works on AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises.

![|298x371](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-86.webp)

### Exam Tip

- If you see **“Kubernetes on AWS” → Think Amazon EKS**.
- If you see **“multi-cloud containers” → Think Kubernetes (EKS on AWS)**.


**Quick Recall**:

- **ECS** → AWS-native container orchestration.
- **EKS** → Kubernetes (open-source, cloud-agnostic) managed by AWS.
- **Fargate** → Serverless option for both ECS & EKS.
- **ECR** → Stores container images for ECS/EKS/Fargate.


## Serverless (Intro)
---

### What is Serverless?

- A **paradigm** where developers **don’t manage servers**.
- Developers focus on **deploying code / functions** only.
- Originally started as **Function as a Service (FaaS)** with **AWS Lambda**.
- Today, “serverless” = **fully managed services** (compute, storage, DB, messaging).

### Key Points

- **Serverless ≠ no servers** → servers exist, but **you don’t provision, manage, or see them**.
- AWS handles **scaling, provisioning, availability**.

### Examples of Serverless Services

- **Amazon S3** → Storage (infinite scale, no servers managed).
- **Amazon DynamoDB** → Serverless database, auto scales with load.
- **AWS Fargate** → Run containers without managing EC2 instances.
- **AWS Lambda** → Pioneer of serverless, runs functions in the cloud.


![|715x266](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-87.webp)

### Exam Tip

- If a question says **“no server management”** or **“serverless compute”** → Think **Lambda**.
- If it’s **serverless database** → DynamoDB.
- If it’s **serverless storage** → S3.
- If it’s **serverless containers** → Fargate.


**Quick Recall**: Serverless = **No server management, fully managed, auto-scaling, pay-per-use**.


## What is AWS Lambda?
---

- Serverless compute service where you run **functions instead of servers**.
- Functions are **short-lived** and **event-driven** (triggered when needed).
- No need to provision or manage servers.

### Comparison with EC2

- **EC2**: Always running, billed for uptime, scaling with Auto Scaling Groups (slower and more complex).
- **Lambda**: Runs only on demand, billed per request and execution time, scaling is automatic.

![|715x395](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-88.webp)

### Benefits of AWS Lambda

- **Pricing**:
   - Free tier: **1M requests/month** and **400,000 GB-seconds/month**.
   - After free tier: **$0.20 per 1M requests**.
   - Pay only per request and compute time.
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with demand.
- **Integration**: Works with many AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, etc).
- **Monitoring**: Built-in with CloudWatch.
- **Resource allocation**: Up to **10 GB RAM per function**. Increasing RAM also boosts CPU and network.

### Supported Languages

- Native: Node.js, Python, Java, C# (.NET Core, PowerShell), Ruby.
- Custom runtimes: Rust, Go, etc via **Custom Runtime API**.
- Can run **container images**, but for Docker workloads prefer **ECS or Fargate** in exams.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Serverless thumbnail creation**:
   - User uploads image to S3 → triggers Lambda → generates thumbnail → saves to S3 → metadata to DynamoDB.
   - Fully serverless and event-driven.

![|715x382](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-89.webp)


2. **Serverless CRON jobs**:
   - Instead of EC2 CRON, use **CloudWatch Events / EventBridge** to trigger Lambda on schedule.
   - Example: Run a script every hour.

### Key Exam Points

- Lambda = **event-driven**, **reactive**, **serverless**.
- Pay attention to **S3 + Lambda use cases**.
- For containers, **prefer ECS/Fargate** over Lambda in exam context.
- Main languages to remember: **Node.js** and **Python**.


## Amazon API Gateway
---

### What is API Gateway?

- **Fully managed, serverless service** to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs in AWS.
- Used to **expose Lambda functions** (or other backends) as REST or WebSocket APIs.
- Provides the **entry point** for clients to interact with serverless apps.

### Typical Serverless Use Case

- **Lambda + DynamoDB** (serverless compute + serverless database).
- Problem: Lambda is **not directly exposed** to external clients.
- Solution: **API Gateway** acts as a front door, exposing a **REST API** or **WebSocket API**.
- Flow:
   - Client → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB.


![|715x126](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-90.webp)

### Key Features

- **Scalable and serverless** (no infrastructure to manage).
- Supports:
   - **RESTful APIs**.
   - **WebSocket APIs** (real-time communication).
- **Security and Access Control**:
   - User authentication (e.g., Cognito, IAM).
   - API keys.
   - Throttling (limit requests).
- **Monitoring** via CloudWatch.

### Exam Tips

- If the question mentions **serverless API** → Answer is **API Gateway + Lambda**.
- If it’s about **real-time streaming API** → Think **API Gateway WebSockets**.
- Remember: It is **serverless, fully managed, and auto-scales**.


**Quick Recall**:  
API Gateway = **Serverless API front door for Lambda and other AWS services**.



## AWS Batch
---

### What is AWS Batch?

- **Fully managed batch processing service**.
- Runs **hundreds of thousands of batch jobs** at any scale.
- A **batch job** = has a start and an end (not continuous like streaming jobs).

### How It Works

- You submit or schedule jobs into a **batch queue**.
- AWS Batch **dynamically provisions compute** (EC2 or Spot Instances).
- Automatically allocates **right amount of vCPU, memory, and storage**.
- Runs jobs as **Docker images on ECS** (anything that runs on ECS can run on Batch).

### Example Workflow

1. User uploads images to **Amazon S3**.
2. Upload triggers a **Batch Job**.
3. Batch launches **ECS cluster** (EC2 or Spot Instances).
4. Jobs run inside **Docker containers**.
5. Processed output (e.g., filtered image) stored back in **Amazon S3**.

### Features

- **Scales automatically** (adds/removes instances as needed).
- **Cost optimization** (Spot Instances supported).
- **No need to manage infrastructure**, focus only on jobs.
- Supports **any runtime** if packaged as a Docker container.

### AWS Batch vs AWS Lambda

| Feature             | AWS Lambda         | AWS Batch                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Execution Limit** | 15 minutes max     | No time limit (depends on EC2)    |
| **Runtime**         | Limited languages  | Any runtime (via Docker image)    |
| **Storage**         | Small temp storage | EC2 storage (EBS, Instance Store) |
| **Infra Type**      | Serverless         | Managed service (uses EC2/Spot)   |
| **Scaling**         | Fully serverless   | Scales EC2 automatically          |

![|715x384](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-91.webp)

### Exam Tips

- If the workload = **short, event-driven tasks** → Use **Lambda**.
- If the workload = **long-running, heavy compute, or custom runtime** → Use **AWS Batch**.
- Remember: AWS Batch is **not serverless**, but AWS manages the EC2 infra for you.

**Quick Recall**:  
AWS Batch = **Managed batch job processing using ECS + EC2/Spot, scalable, no time limit, Docker-based**.
