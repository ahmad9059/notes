## AWS Security & Compliance
---

### Shared Responsibility Model

**Definition:**  
The framework that defines which security tasks are handled by AWS and which are managed by the customer.

**Key Idea:**

- **AWS** is responsible **for security _of_ the cloud.**
- **Customer** is responsible **for security _in_ the cloud.**

### AWS Responsibility (Security _of_ the Cloud)

AWS manages and secures:

- **Infrastructure:** Hardware, software, networking, facilities.
- **Managed Services:** Full responsibility for services like **S3, DynamoDB, RDS**.
- **Global Infrastructure:** Regions, Availability Zones (AZs), and Edge Locations.
- **Compute, Storage, Database, and Networking layers** of their services.
- **Service Software:** Ensuring AWS services are updated, secure, and operational.

**Example:**  
For **RDS**, AWS handles:

- OS and DB patching.
- Disabling SSH access.
- Maintaining uptime and reliability of the underlying instance.

### Customer Responsibility (Security _in_ the Cloud)

Customers secure and manage:

- **Data & Applications.**
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM).**
- **Operating Systems (EC2, etc.):** Patching, updating, configuring firewalls (Security Groups, NACLs).
- **Encryption:** Enabling data encryption (client-side, server-side, in-transit).
- **Network configuration:** Setting up firewall rules, ports, and IPs.
- **User permissions:** Creating and managing database or IAM users correctly.
- **Compliance:** Ensuring configurations meet security standards.

**Example:**

- For **EC2**, the customer must:
   - Patch OS and apps.
   - Configure security groups and IAM roles.
   - Encrypt application data.
- For **S3**, the customer must:
   - Manage bucket policies and access control.
   - Enable encryption as needed.
   - Use IAM users/roles properly.

### Shared Controls

Some controls are **shared** between AWS and the customer.

|**Shared Control**|**AWS Responsibility**|**Customer Responsibility**|
|---|---|---|
|**Patch Management**|AWS patches managed services (e.g., RDS).|Customer patches self-managed instances (e.g., EC2).|
|**Configuration Management**|Provides secure configurations for services.|Configures services properly based on usage.|
|**Awareness & Training**|Trains AWS staff to follow security practices.|Trains employees to securely use AWS services.|

### Example Responsibilities

#### RDS Example

| **AWS Handles**                        | **Customer Handles**                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Underlying EC2 instance & OS patching. | Port and IP rules (security groups).            |
| DB patching automation.                | Database user creation and permissions.         |
| Disk reliability and performance.      | Choosing public/private DB access.              |
| Disabling SSH access.                  | Enabling encryption inside the DB (if desired). |

#### S3 Example

|**AWS Handles**|**Customer Handles**|
|---|---|
|Unlimited storage capacity.|Configuring bucket policies.|
|Physical data separation between customers.|Managing IAM roles and permissions.|
|Data encryption feature availability.|Enabling and choosing encryption options.|
|Ensuring AWS employees cannot access customer data.|Setting access control lists (ACLs).|

### Summary: Shared Responsibility Diagram

**Customer (Security _in_ the Cloud):**

- Data, applications, identity & access management.
- OS, network, and firewall configurations.
- Encryption (client-side and server-side).
- Network traffic protection.


**AWS (Security _of_ the Cloud):**

- Software, compute, storage, databases, networking.
- Hardware and physical infrastructure.
- Global infrastructure (Regions, AZs, Edge Locations).

### Exam Tip

- **Expect 2–3 exam questions** on the Shared Responsibility Model.
- Focus on identifying whether a responsibility belongs to **AWS**, **Customer**, or is **Shared**.



## AWS DDoS Protection & Security Services
---

### What is a DDoS Attack?

**DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**

- Attack where **many compromised systems (bots)** flood your server with requests.
- Goal: **Overwhelm** the application so it becomes **unresponsive** to legitimate users.
- Results in **downtime** or **denied access** for real users.

**Example Flow:**

1. Attacker controls many **master servers**.
2. Each master launches **thousands of bots**.
3. Bots send excessive requests to your **application server**.
4. The server becomes **overloaded and crashes**.

![|715x407](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-144.webp)


### AWS Services that Protect Against DDoS

#### AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)

Protects **web applications (Layer 7)** from **common web exploits**.

**Deployed On:**

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **CloudFront**
- **API Gateway** (out of scope for CCP exam)

**Functions:**

- Filters requests using **Web ACLs (Access Control Lists)**.
- Rules can filter by:
   - **IP address**
   - **HTTP headers or body**
   - **Strings or patterns**
   - **Geo-location** (block countries)
   - **Request size limits**

**Protects Against:**

- **SQL Injection**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **HTTP flood (Layer 7 DDoS)** using **Rate-Based Rules**  
   → e.g., limit 5 requests per second per IP.

#### (c) AWS CloudFront

- A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** with **edge locations** worldwide.
- **Caches content** to reduce load on origin servers.
- When combined with **Shield**, attacks are **mitigated at edge locations** (before reaching your application).

#### (d) Amazon Route 53

- DNS service that is also **protected by AWS Shield**.
- Prevents **DNS-based DDoS attacks** (e.g., DNS flood attacks).

#### (e) Auto Scaling

- Helps **mitigate large-scale attacks** by automatically **adding more instances** to handle increased traffic.
- Not a direct defense but improves **availability under heavy load**.

## Penetration Testing on AWS Cloud

### What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing (pen testing) means **attacking your own infrastructure** to identify and fix security vulnerabilities before real attackers exploit them.

### AWS Penetration Testing Policy

AWS **allows customers** to perform security assessments and penetration tests **without prior approval** on **eight specific services**.

#### Authorized AWS Services (No Approval Needed):

1. **Amazon EC2** instances
2. **NAT Gateways** and **Elastic Load Balancers**
3. **Amazon RDS**
4. **Amazon CloudFront**
5. **Amazon Aurora**
6. **AWS API Gateway**
7. **AWS Lambda** and **Lambda@Edge functions**
8. **Amazon Lightsail** and **Elastic Beanstalk** environments

_(The list may expand over time, but this is not typically tested in exams.)_

### Prohibited / Restricted Activities

You **cannot** perform activities that simulate attacks on AWS infrastructure.

#### Disallowed Actions:

- **DNS zone walking** via **Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone**
- **DoS**, **DDoS**, or **Simulated DoS/DDoS attacks**
- **Port flooding**, **protocol flooding**, or **request flooding**

These are seen as real attacks by AWS and can lead to suspension or investigation.

### When to Contact AWS Security

For **any penetration test** or **security activity** not listed among the eight authorized services, you must **contact AWS Security** for prior approval.

### Exam Tip

For the AWS exam:

- Remember: **Pen testing = allowed on 8 services only.**
- **DoS, DDoS, DNS walking, and flooding = NOT allowed.**
- Anything suspicious to AWS = prohibited.



## AWS Encryption Overview
---

### What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of **converting data into a secure format** so that only authorized parties can access it.  
In AWS, encryption ensures data **confidentiality and protection** at all times.

### Two Types of Encryption in AWS

#### Encryption at Rest

- Protects **data stored on physical media** (not moving).
- Examples:
   - **EBS volumes**
   - **RDS databases**
   - **S3 buckets / Glacier**
   - **EFS network drives**
- Data is encrypted **where it’s stored** (hard disk, storage service, etc.).

#### Encryption in Transit

- Protects **data being transferred** over a network (data in motion).
- Examples:
   - From **on-premises to AWS**
   - Between **EC2 and DynamoDB**
   - Between **EFS and S3**
- Usually uses **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to protect data.

👉 **Best Practice:**  
Encrypt data **both at rest and in transit** for end-to-end protection.


![|715x171](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-147.webp)


### Encryption Keys

- Encryption uses **keys** to encode/decode data.
- Without access to the key, the data **cannot be decrypted**.
- AWS uses **KMS (Key Management Service)** to handle keys.

### AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

#### What it does

- Manages encryption keys securely.
- Allows you to control **who can use or manage keys**.
- AWS handles most of the backend key management.

#### Where KMS is used

- **EBS**: Encrypt volumes
- **S3**: Server-side encryption of objects
- **RDS / Redshift / EFS**: Encrypt databases and files
- **CloudTrail logs**, **S3 Glacier**, and **Storage Gateway** are **encrypted by default**.

### AWS CloudHSM (Hardware Security Module)

|**Feature**|**KMS**|**CloudHSM**|
|---|---|---|
|Key Management|Managed by AWS|Managed by Customer|
|Type|Software-based|Hardware-based|
|Access to Keys|AWS controls|Customer controls|
|Hardware Ownership|Shared|Dedicated (HSM device)|
|Compliance|General encryption|FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliant|
|Use Case|General use|High-security / regulatory use|

- CloudHSM = AWS provides **hardware**, but **you manage your own keys**.
- HSM device is **tamper-resistant**, and all cryptographic operations happen inside it.

![|715x287](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-148.webp)

### Types of KMS Keys

|**Key Type**|**Description**|**Managed By**|**Example / Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Customer Managed Keys (CMK)**|Created and managed by you. You can enable/disable keys and rotate them yearly.|Customer|Most control (can bring your own key).|
|**AWS Managed Keys**|Created and managed by AWS **on your behalf**.|AWS|Named like `aws/s3`, `aws/ebs`.|
|**AWS Owned Keys**|Managed entirely by AWS, used across accounts. You can’t view or control them.|AWS|For AWS-internal encryption needs.|
|**CloudHSM Keys / Custom Key Store**|Keys generated and managed in your own CloudHSM hardware.|Customer|Highest control and isolation.|

### Summary Chart

|**Concept**|**Purpose**|**Example Services**|
|---|---|---|
|Encryption at Rest|Protects stored data|S3, EBS, RDS, EFS|
|Encryption in Transit|Protects data in motion|EC2 → S3, On-prem → AWS|
|KMS|Software-based key management|S3, EBS, RDS|
|CloudHSM|Hardware-based key management|Financial or government workloads|
|Default Encryption|Always on|CloudTrail, Glacier, Storage Gateway|

### Exam Tips

- **Encryption at rest:** Data stored (S3, EBS, RDS).
- **Encryption in transit:** Data moving (TLS/SSL).
- **KMS:** AWS manages keys.
- **CloudHSM:** You manage keys on dedicated hardware.
- **aws/** prefix = AWS-managed key.
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** = Customer-managed.
- **FIPS 140-2 Level 3** = CloudHSM compliance standard.

## AWS Artifact – Security & Compliance
---

### Purpose

**AWS Artifact** is a **self-service portal** that provides **on-demand access** to:

- **AWS compliance reports**
- **AWS agreements**

It is **not a service** like EC2 or S3, but a **portal for downloading and managing compliance-related documents**.

### Key Features

1. **Compliance Reports (Artifact Reports)**
   - These are **security and compliance documents** from **third-party auditors**.
   - Help verify that AWS services meet various **global compliance standards**.
   - Common reports include:
       - **ISO certifications**
       - **PCI (Payment Card Industry)** reports
       - **SOC (System and Organization Controls)** reports
2. **Agreements (Artifact Agreements)**
   - Allows users to **review, accept, and track AWS legal/compliance agreements**.
   - Examples:
       - **BAA (Business Associate Addendum)** for healthcare compliance
       - **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)** agreements
   - Can be applied to **individual accounts or entire AWS Organizations**.
3. **Use in Compliance & Audits**
   - Helps companies **support internal audits** and **demonstrate compliance** when using AWS Cloud.
   - Documents can be downloaded after accepting the **NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)**.
4. **Access**
   - **Global service** (accessible in all regions).
   - Available through the **AWS Management Console → AWS Artifact**.

### How It Works

1. Open **AWS Artifact** in the Console.
2. Choose:
   - **View Reports** to download audit/compliance reports.

## AWS Config – Security & Compliance
---

### Purpose

AWS Config is a **compliance and auditing service** that continuously **monitors, records, and evaluates the configuration of AWS resources** to ensure they comply with organizational security and governance rules.

### Key Functions

1. **Configuration Recording**
   - Tracks and records changes made to AWS resources.
   - Maintains a **history of configurations** for each resource.
2. **Compliance Evaluation**
   - Uses **Config Rules** to check if resources comply with security standards or policies.
   - Example rules:
       - `restricted-ssh` (checks for open SSH ports)
       - `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`
       - `rds-instance-public-access-check`
3. **Storage & Analysis**
   - Configuration data is stored in **Amazon S3**.
   - Can be analyzed using **Athena** or other tools.
4. **Change Notifications**
   - Sends alerts via **Amazon SNS** when resource configurations change or become noncompliant.
5. **Visibility & Accountability**
   - Integrates with **AWS CloudTrail** to identify **who made specific configuration changes**.
   - Displays compliance **timelines and history** for each resource.

### How AWS Config Works

1. **Enable Config** from the AWS Management Console.
2. **Select resources** to record (specific or all resources).
3. Config creates:
    - **An S3 bucket** for storing configuration data.
    - **A service-linked IAM role** for Config.
4. **Set Config Rules** (e.g., restricted SSH access).
5. Config continuously:
    - **Monitors and records** configurations.
    - **Evaluates compliance** against rules.
    - **Sends notifications** for any violations.

### Compliance Example

**Scenario:**  
A security group allows unrestricted SSH access (`0.0.0.0/0`).

**Steps:**

1. Config marks it as **noncompliant** under the `restricted-ssh` rule.
2. The admin removes the open SSH rule.
3. Config re-evaluates and marks it **compliant (green)**.
4. The configuration timeline shows:
   - Initial noncompliance
   - Rule change
   - Compliance restored
   - CloudTrail logs confirm the change was made by the root user.

### Aggregation & Scope

- **Regional service**, but results can be **aggregated across multiple accounts and regions**.
- Useful for **enterprise-level compliance visibility**.

### Pricing & Access

- **Not free** — charges per configuration item recorded and evaluated.
- Access via **AWS Management Console → AWS Config**.

### **Common Use Cases**

- Detect **unrestricted SSH access**.
- Identify **publicly accessible S3 buckets**.
- Track **ALB or EC2 configuration changes**.

- Provides **visualizations and context** for incidents.
- Gives a **unified view** of security-related data.
- Helps you understand **who did what, when, and from where**.

### Key Idea

> Amazon Detective doesn’t detect issues; it helps you **investigate and understand them**.


## AWS Abuse Reporting
---

### Purpose

- To **report abusive or illegal activities** happening through AWS resources.

### When to Report

You should contact the **AWS Abuse Team** if you notice:

- **Spam** emails coming from AWS-owned IPs
- **Spam** on websites or forums using AWS resources
- **Port scanning** activity from AWS servers
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** attacks
- **Intrusion attempts** on your systems from AWS IPs
- **Hosting of illegal or copyrighted content** on AWS
- **Distribution of malware** from AWS infrastructure

### How to Report

You can report abuse in two ways:

1. **Online form** (available on AWS Abuse page)
2. **Email**: 📧 **[abuse@amazonaws.com](mailto:abuse@amazonaws.com)**

### Exam Tip

> For the AWS exam, just remember:  
> If you suspect abuse or illegal activity from AWS resources, **email the AWS Abuse Team** at  
> ➡️ **[abuse@amazonaws.com](mailto:abuse@amazonaws.com)**



## AWS Root User Privileges
---

### What is the Root User?

- The **Root User** is the **original account owner** created when an AWS account is first made.
- It has **full, unrestricted access** to **all AWS services and resources**.

### Best Practice

- **Never use the root account** for daily or administrative tasks.
- **Create an IAM user** with admin privileges instead.
- **Secure the root account credentials** (especially the secret access keys).
- **Enable MFA** (Multi-Factor Authentication) on the root account.

### Actions Only the Root User Can Perform

These are **exclusive to the root user** and may appear on the exam:

1. **Account Management**
   - Change **account name**, **root email**, **root password**, or **root access keys**.
   - View **certain tax invoices**.
   - **Close the AWS account**.
2. **IAM and Permissions**
   - **Restore IAM user permissions** if permissions are accidentally removed.
3. **Support Plans**
   - **Change or cancel** your AWS Support plan.
4. **Reserved Instance Marketplace**
   - **Register as a seller** in the **Reserved Instance Marketplace**.  
       _(Example: If you bought a 3-year Reserved Instance but don’t need it after 2 years, you can resell it — only the root user can register as a seller.)_
5. **Amazon S3**
   - **Enable MFA Delete** on an S3 bucket.
   - **Edit or delete bucket policies** that contain **invalid VPC IDs or endpoint IDs**.
6. **AWS GovCloud**
   - **Sign up for AWS GovCloud**.

### Exam Tip

> Remember: **Root user = full control**, but **should only be used for rare, account-level operations** like closing the account or changing billing details.



## IAM Access Analyzer (AWS)
---

### Purpose

- Helps **identify AWS resources shared externally** (outside your AWS account or organization).
- Detects **potential unintended access** to your resources.
- Built into the **IAM console** and **free to use**.

### Resources it Analyzes

IAM Access Analyzer checks these for external sharing:

- **S3 Buckets**
- **IAM Roles**
- **KMS Keys**
- **Lambda Functions and Layers**
- **SQS Queues**
- **Secrets Manager Secrets**

### Concept of Zone of Trust

- Defines what’s considered **“internal”** or **trusted**.
- Can be:
   - Your **AWS account**, or
   - Your **AWS Organization** (all accounts under it).
- Anything **outside** this zone is **flagged** as a **finding**.

### How It Works

1. **You create an analyzer** in the IAM console.
   - Example name: `console-analyzer`.
   - Choose zone of trust (usually current account).
   - Optionally, add tags.
2. It **creates a service-linked role** to scan your resources.
3. **Findings** show resources shared externally.


![|367x468](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-154.webp)

### Example

Suppose you have an **S3 bucket** or **SQS queue** shared:

- With **another AWS account**,
- With **an external client**,
- With **all principals** (`*`),
- Or through an **open bucket policy**.

If it’s **outside your zone of trust**, Access Analyzer reports it.

### Managing Findings

Findings can have different **statuses**:

- **Active** – Currently shared externally.
- **Resolved** – Fixed (no longer shared).
- **Archived** – Intended sharing; ignored in future scans.

### Example Workflow

1. Analyzer finds **3 findings**:
   - 1 SQS queue
   - 2 S3 buckets
1. You check the **SQS policy**, see that it allows `SendMessage` from anyone (`*`).
2. You **edit or remove** that policy.
3. **Rescan** → Status becomes **Resolved**.
4. For intended public buckets, you **archive** them.

### Automation

- You can create **Archive Rules** to automatically mark specific types of findings (e.g., public S3 buckets) as archived.

### Key Benefits

- **Improves security visibility**
- **Reduces misconfigurations**
- **Helps ensure least privilege access**

### Exam Tip / Interview Notes

- **IAM Access Analyzer** uses **resource-based policies** to identify external access.
- **Zone of Trust** = trusted boundary (account or organization).
- **Findings** are based on **policy analysis**, not actual usage.
- It’s **free**, **automated**, and **available in IAM console**.
