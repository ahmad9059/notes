**Budgeting ->** [Enabling Billing Access for IAM Users](1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/Extra/Enabling%20Billing%20Access%20for%20IAM%20Users.md)

## Amazon EC2 
---

- EC2 = **Elastic Compute Cloud**
- AWS **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering
- Lets you **rent virtual servers (instances)** on-demand

### EC2 Components

- **Instances** → Virtual machines (VMs)
- **EBS Volumes** → Virtual drives for storage
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** → Distributes traffic across instances
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** → Scales instances automatically

### Instance Configuration Options

- **OS Choices**: Linux (most popular), Windows, MacOS
- **Compute**: Number of vCPUs (cores)
- **Memory (RAM)**: Customizable
- **Storage**:
   - **EBS/EFS** (network-attached)
   - **Instance Store** (hardware-attached)
- **Networking**:
   - Network card speed
   - Public IP options
- **Security Groups**: Firewall rules for instance
- **Bootstrap (User Data)**: Script executed **at first launch**
   - Installs software, updates, downloads files, etc.
   - Runs as **root (sudo rights)**


### Instance Types Examples

|Instance|vCPU|Mem (GiB)|Storage|Network Performance|EBS Bandwidth (Mbps)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|t2.micro|1|1|EBS-Only|Low to Moderate|-|
|t2.xlarge|4|16|EBS-Only|Moderate|4,750|
|c5d.4xlarge|16|32|1 x 400 NVMe SSD|Up to 10 Gbps|4,750|
|r5.16xlarge|64|512|EBS Only|20 Gbps|13,600|
|m5.8xlarge|32|128|EBS Only|10 Gbps|6,800|
### Free Tier

- **t2.micro**: Up to **750 hours per month** free (~1 instance running continuously for a month)

## EC2 Instance Types
---

- Different workloads need different optimizations: compute, memory, storage, or networking.
- AWS provides several categories of instances to match use cases.

**Detail of Each Instance ->:** https://instances.vantage.sh 
**Each Category Details ->:** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types 

### Naming Convention

Example: `m5.2xlarge`

- **M** = Instance class (General Purpose)
- **5** = Generation (newer number = newer hardware, better performance)
- **2xlarge** = Size within the class
   - Scales up: small → large → xlarge → 2xlarge → 4xlarge → …
   - Larger size = more vCPU, memory, and network performance.

### Major EC2 Instance Categories

#### General Purpose

- **Balanced** between compute, memory, and networking.
- **Use cases:** Web servers, code repositories, small/medium databases.
- **Examples:** T2/T3 (burstable), M5/M6.
- **Exam Tip:** Free tier uses **t2.micro** (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 750 hrs/month).

#### Compute Optimized

- **Optimized for high-performance CPU needs.**
- **Use cases:**
   - Batch processing
   - Media transcoding
   - High-performance web servers
   - High Performance Computing (HPC)
   - Machine learning (CPU-based)
   - Gaming servers
- **Examples:** C5, C6 (C = Compute).

![|715x189](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-17.webp)

#### Memory Optimized

- **Optimized for large datasets processed in-memory (RAM).**
- **Use cases:**
   - Relational & NoSQL databases
   - In-memory databases (Redis, Memcached)
   - Caching layers (ElastiCache)
   - Business intelligence (BI), data analytics
   - Real-time big data processing
- **Examples:**
   - R series (RAM-focused)
   - X1 (extra high memory)
   - Z1 (specialized)

![|715x181](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-18.webp)


#### Storage Optimized

- **Optimized for workloads requiring high, sequential read/write on local storage.**
- **Use cases:**
   - High-frequency OLTP systems
   - Relational & NoSQL DBs
   - Caches for in-memory DBs
   - Data warehousing apps
   - Distributed file systems (e.g., Hadoop)
   - Search engines
- **Examples:** I3, H1, D2.


![|715x169](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-19.webp)

#### Graphics Optimized

- Designed for **graphics-intensive** workloads.
- Use specialized **NVIDIA GPUs** for rendering, streaming, and visualization.
- Focus is on **graphics acceleration**, not deep learning (that’s P family).

##### Common Instances

**G3 / G4ad / G4dn / G5**
- Equipped with NVIDIA GPUs
- Provide high-quality remote visualization
##### Use Cases

- Video rendering & transcoding
- 3D visualization (architecture, engineering, design)
- Game streaming (cloud gaming services)
- Virtual desktops (VDI, e.g. AWS WorkSpaces)
- Augmented Reality (AR) / Virtual Reality (VR) applications
##### Exam Tip

- **G = Graphics**
- Don’t confuse with:
   - **P family (GPU for Machine Learning / Compute)**
   - **F family (FPGA programmable hardware)**

## AWS Security Groups (SGs)
---

- Security Groups = Virtual firewalls for **EC2 instances**.
- Control **inbound (into instance)** and **outbound (from instance)** traffic.
- They are **stateful** and only contain **allow rules** (no explicit deny).


![|715x154](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-20.webp)

### Rules

- Rules can reference:
   - **IP addresses** (IPv4, IPv6).
   - **Other Security Groups** (important for load balancers and multi-tier setups).
- Rules define: **Type (service)**, **Protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP)**, **Port range**, **Source/Destination**.
- `0.0.0.0/0` = all IPv4 addresses, `::/0` = all IPv6 addresses.

![|715x79](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-23.webp)

### Default Behavior

- **Inbound**: All traffic blocked by default.
- **Outbound**: All traffic allowed by default.

![|715x292](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-21.webp)

### Key Characteristics

- Can be attached to **multiple instances**.
- An instance can have **multiple security groups**.
- Scoped to a **Region + VPC** (must recreate in another Region/VPC).
- Operate **outside the EC2 instance** (traffic blocked before reaching the OS).
- **Timeout** = Security Group is blocking traffic.
- **Connection Refused** = SG allowed traffic, but the app on the instance is not running/accepting connections.

### Advanced Feature

**Security Group Referencing**:
- SGs can authorize other SGs.
- Example: Web SG allows inbound only from Load Balancer SG.
- Avoids managing dynamic IPs, simplifies multi-instance communication.

### Important Ports to Memorize (for Exam)

- **22** → SSH (Linux login)
- **21** → FTP (File transfer)
- **22** → SFTP (Secure FTP using SSH)
- **80** → HTTP (Unsecured websites)
- **443** → HTTPS (Secured websites, standard today)
- **3389** → RDP (Windows login)


## SSH into EC2 (Linux/Mac)
---

- Secure Shell, used to control remote servers via terminal.
- Connects to EC2 instance over port **22**.

### Pre-requisites:

- EC2 instance running (Amazon Linux 2).
- Security Group allows **port 22 (SSH)** from `0.0.0.0/0`.
- `.pem` key pair file downloaded (rename to remove spaces).

### Steps:

1. Place `.pem` file in a safe folder (e.g., `aws-course`).
2. Get **Public IPv4** of your EC2 instance.
3. Open terminal in the same directory as `.pem`.

### SSH Command:

```bash
ssh -i path/to/.pem <USERNAME>@<PUBLIC_IP>
```

#### Common usernames based on AMI:

- Amazon Linux → `ec2-user`
- Ubuntu → `ubuntu`
- RHEL → `ec2-user`
- CentOS → `centos`
- Debian → `admin` or `debian`
### Common Issues:

- _Too many authentication failures_ → You didn’t specify key with `-i`.
- _Unprotected private key file_ → Fix with:

```bash
chmod 400 file.pem
```


### Verify Connection:

- Prompt changes to `ec2-user@<IP>`.
- Run:

```bash
whoami   # should print ec2-user
ping google.com
```

**Exit SSH:** Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.


Here are concise notes for that lecture:

## EC2 Instance Connect (Alternative to SSH)
---

### 1. What It Is

- A **browser-based SSH session** into your EC2 instance.
- No need to install SSH client or manage `.pem` keys.
- AWS automatically uploads a **temporary SSH key**.

### How to Use

1. Go to **EC2 Console → Instances → Select Instance → Connect**.
2. Choose **EC2 Instance Connect**.
3. Default username = **ec2-user** (for Amazon Linux 2).
4. Click **Connect** → browser terminal opens.

![|715x274](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-24.webp)
### Benefits

- No SSH key management required.
- Works directly in the browser.
- Quick way to access EC2 for testing or troubleshooting.

### Behind the Scenes

- Still relies on **SSH over port 22**.
- Security Group must allow **Inbound SSH (port 22)**.
- May require both **IPv4 (0.0.0.0/0)** and **IPv6 (::/0)** rules.

### Common Issues

- **EC2 Instance Connect fails** → check that port 22 is open.
- If using IPv6, ensure you also allow IPv6 SSH in Security Group.

### Exam Tip

- EC2 Instance Connect = easy SSH alternative.
- Still requires **port 22 open** in SG.


**Quick Command Check in Browser Session**:

```bash
whoami         # should return ec2-user
ping google.com
```


### IAM Roles for EC2 Instances

- **Connection**: Access your EC2 instance (via SSH or EC2 Instance Connect).
- **AWS CLI**: Amazon Linux AMI comes with AWS CLI pre-installed.
- **Bad Practice**:
   - Never run `aws configure` and enter Access Key + Secret Key inside an EC2 instance.
   - Credentials can be stolen if others access the instance.
- **Correct Approach**: Use **IAM Roles**.
   - Create an IAM Role with required policy (e.g., `IAMReadOnlyAccess`).
   - Attach the role to your EC2 instance (Actions → Security → Modify IAM Role).
   - The instance automatically gets temporary credentials via the metadata service.

### Demo Flow

1. Run `aws iam list-users` before attaching role → **Fails (no credentials)**.
2. Attach IAM Role to instance.
3. Detach policy from the role → **Access denied**.
4. Re-attach policy → **Works after propagation delay**.

### Key Point

- **Always** use **IAM Roles** to give EC2 instances permissions.
- Never hardcode or manually configure credentials on the instance.

## EC2 Purchasing Options
---

### On-Demand

- Pay per second (Linux/Windows) after 1st minute, per hour for others.
- No upfront payment, no long-term commitment.
- Highest cost.
- Best for: short-term, unpredictable workloads.


### Reserved Instances (RIs)

- Commit for **1 or 3 years**.
- Up to **72% discount** vs on-demand.
- Specify: instance type, region, tenancy, OS.
- Payment: all upfront, partial, or none (all upfront = max discount).
- Scope: Regional or AZ-specific (reserve capacity).
- Best for: steady-state workloads (databases).
- Convertible RIs: flexibility to change type/family/OS/scope/tenancy, lower discount (up to 66%).
- Can be bought/sold on **RI Marketplace**.


### Savings Plans

- Commit to spending ($/hr) for **1 or 3 years**.
- Up to **70% discount**.
- More flexible than RIs:
   - Switch between OS, tenancy, and instance size in same family/region.
- Usage beyond plan = on-demand pricing.


### Spot Instances

- Up to **90% discount**.
- AWS can reclaim instances anytime if spot price > your bid.
- Best for: fault-tolerant, flexible workloads (batch jobs, analytics, image processing, distributed systems).
- Not for: critical jobs, databases.


### Dedicated Hosts

- Book an entire physical server.
- Use case: compliance needs, bring-your-own-license (per-socket/core/VM).
- Pricing: on-demand (per second) or reserved (1 or 3 years).
- Most expensive option.
- Gives **hardware-level visibility**.

### Dedicated Instances

- Run on hardware dedicated to you.
- No control over placement.
- May share hardware with other instances in same account.
- Difference from dedicated hosts:
   - **Instances** = dedicated compute, no hardware visibility.
   - **Hosts** = full physical server, compliance/license control.

### Capacity Reservations

- Reserve on-demand instances in a specific **AZ**.
- Duration: any, cancel anytime.
- No time commitment, no billing discount.
- Guarantees capacity when needed.


### Which Purchasing Option is Right For Me?

## AWS IPv4 Charges
---

- **Charge**: $0.005/hour per Public IPv4 (~$3.60/month).
- Applies whether **used or unused**.

### EC2 Free Tier

- 12 months after account creation.
- **750 hours/month of Public IPv4** (≈ 1 IPv4 for a full month).
- Shared across all EC2 instances in account.
- Additional IPs or exceeding 750 hrs → charged at $0.005/hr.
### Other Services

- **No free tier** (always charged):
   - Elastic Load Balancers (1 IPv4 per AZ).
   - Amazon RDS (when public access enabled).
   - Any other service with public IPv4.
### IPv6

- No charge.
- AWS encourages migration to IPv6.
- Limitation: many ISPs worldwide still lack IPv6 support.
- Optional in course: advanced users may configure IPv6 manually.
### Cost Management

- **Check charges**:
   - Billing & Cost Management → Bills → Drill down by service.
   - IPv4 charges appear here.
- **Public IP Insights** (via **Amazon VPC IPAM**):
   - Free tier feature.
   - Lets you monitor IPv4 usage across regions/accounts.
### Best Practices

- Avoid leaving resources running unnecessarily.
- Prefer IPv6 where possible.
- Use **IPAM** to track allocations.

## Shared Responsibility Model – EC2
---

### AWS Responsibilities (Security _of_ the cloud)

- Physical infrastructure: data centers, networking, hardware.
- Isolation of physical hosts (for dedicated hosts).
- Faulty hardware replacement.
- Compliance with global regulations.

### User Responsibilities (Security _in_ the cloud)

- **Network security**: configure **Security Groups** and access rules.
- **Operating System**: patching, updates, maintenance (Windows/Linux).
- **Software & utilities**: install, configure, and secure.
- **IAM roles & permissions**: assign correctly for least-privilege access.
- **Data security**: ensure encryption and safe handling of data on EC2.

✅ AWS secures the infrastructure,  
✅ You secure everything inside your instance.
