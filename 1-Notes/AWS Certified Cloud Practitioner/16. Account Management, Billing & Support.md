## AWS Organizations
---


- **Global Service** used to **manage multiple AWS accounts** centrally.
- The **main account** is called the **Master Account**, and other linked accounts are **Child Accounts**.

### Key Benefits

1. **Consolidated Billing**
   - All accounts share a single payment method managed by the master account.
   - You receive **one combined bill** for all linked accounts.
2. **Pricing Benefits**
   - **Aggregated usage** provides **volume discounts** for services like EC2 and S3 across all accounts.
   - **Reserved Instances (RIs)** are **shared** among accounts for maximum savings.
3. **Automation**
   - **API support** to automate **AWS account creation** (useful for sandbox or departmental accounts).
4. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**
   - Used to **restrict account privileges**.
   - Common exam topic.

### Multi-Account Strategy

#### Why Use Multiple Accounts

- Easier **management** and **security isolation**.
- Organize by:
   - **Department** (Sales, Finance, HR)
   - **Environment** (Dev, Test, Prod)
   - **Project** (Project-1, Project-2, etc.)
   - **Regulatory requirements** (compliance-based isolation)

#### Benefits

- **Separate service limits** per account.
- **Improved resource isolation** (different VPCs per account).
- **Dedicated logging accounts** for central log management.

#### Best Practices

- Apply **tagging standards** across accounts for billing.
- Enable **CloudTrail** and **CloudWatch Logs** in all accounts.
   - Send logs to a **central S3 or logging account** for visibility and compliance.

### Organizational Units (OUs)

- Used to **group related accounts** within an organization.
- Structure Example:
   - **Root OU** (contains Master Account)
   - **Dev OU**, **Prod OU**, etc.
   - Nested OUs possible (e.g., Prod → Finance OU, HR OU).
- Allows **hierarchical policy management** using SCPs.

### Service Control Policies (SCPs)

- Manage permissions **centrally across accounts**.
- **Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions** at OU or account level.
- **Do not apply** to the **Master Account**.

#### Behavior

- Affect **users and roles** (including root users) within child accounts.
- **Do not affect service-linked roles** (used internally by AWS services).
- SCPs must have **explicit “Allow” statements**; otherwise, actions are denied by default.

### Use Cases

- **Restrict access** to specific AWS services (e.g., deny EMR in production).
- **Enforce compliance** (e.g., disable non-PCI-compliant services).

### Examples

1. **Blacklist example:**

 ```json
 {
   "Effect": "Deny",
   "Action": "dynamodb:*",
   "Resource": "*"
 }
```

 -  Denies all DynamoDB actions.

2. **Whitelist example:**

```json
  {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": ["ec2:*", "cloudwatch:*"],
   "Resource": "*"
   }
 ```

 -  Allows only EC2 and CloudWatch actions; all others denied.

### Key Exam Points

- **AWS Organizations = Global Service** for multi-account management.
- **Master account** pays bills via **Consolidated Billing**.
- **Aggregated usage** and **shared RIs** reduce costs.
- **SCPs** manage **account-level permissions**, not IAM roles directly.
- SCPs **don’t apply to the master account** or **service-linked roles**.
- Use **CloudTrail** and **centralized logging** for auditing all accounts.


## AWS Organizations – Consolidated Billing
---

### Purpose

Consolidated Billing in AWS Organizations allows centralized payment management and shared cost benefits across multiple AWS accounts under one organization.

### Key Features

1. **One Bill for All Accounts**
   - The **management (master) account** pays the bill for all linked accounts.
   - Simplifies financial management for the accounting department.
   - No limit on how many accounts can be created and managed.
2. **Combined (Aggregated) Usage**
   - All usage across accounts is aggregated to benefit from **volume discounts**.
   - Example:
       - S3 offers lower pricing after 5 TB.
       - If six accounts each use 1 TB, combined usage (6 TB) qualifies for discounted pricing.
3. **Shared Reserved Instances (RI) and Savings Plans**
   - RI or Savings Plan discounts purchased in one account automatically apply across all accounts in the organization.
   - Maximizes cost efficiency.

### Example: Reserved Instance Sharing

- **Scenario:**
   - Organization has two accounts: **A** and **B**.
   - Account B has **5 reserved EC2 instances**.
   - Across both accounts, **9 EC2 instances** are running in the same Availability Zone (AZ).
- **Outcome:**
   - 3 instances in Account B use 3 of the 5 RIs.
   - 2 of the remaining RIs apply to instances in Account A.
   - Result: **5 instances receive RI pricing**, **4 instances are on-demand**.
   - This demonstrates **cross-account RI sharing**.

### Important Notes

- **Shared Volume Pricing:** Combined usage discounts apply across all linked accounts.
- **Shared RI/Savings Plan:** Enables efficient cost savings across accounts.
- **Optional Control:** RI/Savings Plan discount sharing **can be disabled** for specific accounts, including the management account.
- **Exam Tip:** Know the benefits of combined usage, RI sharing, and the effect of turning sharing off.

### Summary

Consolidated Billing under AWS Organizations provides:

- Centralized billing management.
- Aggregated usage discounts.
- Shared Reserved Instance and Savings Plan pricing.
- Flexibility to manage billing preferences per account.

## AWS Service Catalog
---

### Purpose

AWS Service Catalog enables organizations to **create and manage approved collections of AWS resources** so that users can **quickly deploy authorized products** in a **controlled, consistent, and compliant** manner.

### Problem It Solves

- New AWS users have **too many choices** and may create resources **inconsistently** with company standards.
- Service Catalog provides a **self-service portal** for users to **launch only pre-approved resources** designed by administrators.

### Key Concepts

1. **Product**
   - A **CloudFormation template** that defines a resource or set of resources (e.g., EC2, RDS, S3).
   - Configured with predefined parameters (for consistency and compliance).
2. **Portfolio**
   - A **collection of products** created by administrators.
   - Admins define **who can access** and **launch** products within each portfolio.
3. **Self-Service Portal**
   - End users can view and launch only the products they are permitted to use.
   - When a product is launched, AWS CloudFormation automatically provisions it according to the approved configuration.

### Benefits

- **Standardization:** Ensures all resources follow organizational policies and tagging standards.
- **Compliance:** Prevents users from launching unapproved configurations.
- **Automation:** Uses CloudFormation for automated, consistent provisioning.
- **Access Control:** Admins control which users or groups can deploy specific resources.
- **Ease of Use:** Provides a simple portal for non-technical users to deploy preconfigured infrastructure.

### Example Scenario

## AWS Savings Plans
---

### What are Savings Plans?

A **flexible pricing model** that helps you save money on AWS compute services.  
You commit to spend a **fixed dollar amount per hour** ($/hr) for **1 or 3 years**, and in return, AWS gives you **discounts up to 72%** compared to On-Demand pricing.

You commit to a **spending amount**, not specific instances or resources.  
Simpler than Reserved Instances (no need to specify instance type, region, etc.).

### Types of Savings Plans

#### EC2 Instance Savings Plan

- Up to **72% discount** over On-Demand.
- Commitment applies to **specific instance family** in a **specific region**.  
   Example: Commit **$10/hour** for **C5 family** in a region.
- Flexible across:
   - Availability Zones
   - Instance sizes (e.g., `c5.xlarge`, `c5.4xlarge`)
   - OS (Linux, Windows)
   - Tenancy (shared or dedicated)
- Payment options:
   - **All Upfront** → biggest discount
   - **Partial Upfront**
   - **No Upfront**

#### Compute Savings Plan

- Up to **66% discount**.
- Most **flexible** option.
- Applies **across regions, instance families, sizes, OS, and tenancy**.
- Covers **multiple compute services**:
   - EC2
   - **AWS Fargate** (containers)
   - **AWS Lambda** (serverless)
- You simply commit to a dollar/hour spend, and AWS applies discounts automatically.

#### Machine Learning Savings Plan (SageMaker)

- Applies to **Amazon SageMaker** workloads.
- Example: Using an `ml.t3.large` notebook long-term can save ~**28%**.
- Discounts depend on usage type and duration.

### How to Set Up a Savings Plan

1. Go to **AWS Cost Explorer**.
2. AWS recommends the **right Savings Plan** based on your usage.
3. You can also estimate pricing via the **Savings Plan calculator**.

**Options to configure:**

- Plan Type (EC2, Compute, or SageMaker)
- Term (1 or 3 years)
- Payment (All, Partial, or No Upfront)
- Commitment ($/hour)

### Example Scenario

You commit to **$500/hour** spend for 3 years, partial upfront.  
AWS shows:

- Upfront cost
- Monthly payment
- Total estimated savings

Then you simply **add it to cart**, and your plan applies automatically to matching resources.

### Key Takeaways

- **Savings Plans > Reserved Instances** (simpler and more flexible).
- **Compute Savings Plan** = most flexible, covers EC2, Lambda, Fargate.
- **EC2 Instance Plan** = most savings, but less flexible.
- **Machine Learning Plan** = specialized for SageMaker.
- Commit to a **spend amount**, not instance specs.
- Managed via **Cost Explorer** or **Billing Console**.

## AWS Billing Monitoring and Budgets
---

### Billing Metric

- The **billing metric** is available in **Amazon CloudWatch**, but **only in the region `us-east-1` (N. Virginia)**.
- It **aggregates all AWS costs across all regions** into a single metric.
- The metric tracks **actual cost**, not **forecasted cost**.
- This data can be **visualized as a graph** showing cost over time.

### Billing Alarms

- You can create a **Billing Alarm** using the **billing metric** in CloudWatch.
- Example: You can set an alarm to trigger when total cost exceeds **$70**.
- When the alarm is triggered, AWS can **send an email notification** through **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**.
- Billing alarms are **simple** and **basic**, mainly for alerting when a threshold is crossed.
- However, they are **less powerful** than **AWS Budgets**, which provide deeper insights and more customization.

### AWS Budgets

AWS Budgets allow **detailed monitoring** of costs, usage, and reservations, with alerts and forecasts.

#### Purpose

- Sends alerts when:
   - **Actual cost/usage exceeds** the defined budget.
   - **Forecasted cost/usage** is **expected to exceed** the budget.

#### Types of Budgets

1. **Cost Budget** — Track how much money you spend.
2. **Usage Budget** — Track usage of specific resources (e.g., EC2 hours, S3 GB).
3. **Reservation Budget** — Monitor **Reserved Instance** utilization.
4. **Savings Plan Budget** — Monitor **Savings Plan** utilization.

#### Supported Services for RI Budgets

- **EC2**, **RDS**, **Redshift**, and **ElastiCache** Reserved Instances.

#### Notifications

- Supports **up to 5 SNS notifications per budget**.
   - You can send emails, trigger Lambda functions, or integrate with automation.
- You can **filter budgets** by:
   - Service (e.g., EC2, S3)
   - Linked account (in Organizations)
   - Tag
   - Purchase option
   - Instance type
   - Region or Availability Zone
   - API Operation, etc.

#### Cost

- **First two budgets are free**.
- After that, **$0.02 per day per budget**.

### Creating a Budget (Demo Walkthrough)

#### Step 1: Go to AWS Budgets Console

- Search “Budgets” in the AWS Console.
- You’ll see existing budgets (e.g., _“Don’t go over $10”_) and their usage vs forecast.

#### Step 2: Create a New Budget

- Choose:
   - **Use Template** (predefined)
   - Or **Customize** your own (Cost, Usage, Savings Plan, or Reservation)

#### Step 3: Set Details

- **Budget name:** e.g., `DemoBudget`
- **Period:** Monthly, Quarterly, Annually, or Daily
- **Type:** Recurring or Expiring
- **Start and End Date**
- **Budget amount:** e.g., $10

#### Step 4: Filter Scope

- Apply filters like:
   - Service = `EC2-Other`
   - Or only monitor costs from `Key Management Service (KMS)`
- You can combine multiple filters for fine-grained tracking.

#### Step 5: Set Alerts

- Example:
   - Send email at **80% of actual cost** (e.g., when $8 out of $10 spent)
   - Send email at **80% of forecasted cost**
- Add email recipients, e.g., `stephane@example.com`
- Graphs will visually show budget amount, usage, and alert thresholds.

#### Step 6: Link to Cost Explorer

- AWS Budgets integrates with **Cost Explorer**, so you can drill down into your spending patterns.

### In Short

|Feature|Purpose|Notes|

## AWS Cost Anomaly Detection
---

**Purpose:**  
AWS Cost Anomaly Detection helps you **monitor and identify unusual spending patterns** in your AWS account using **machine learning**.

### Key Features

- **Machine Learning-Based Monitoring:**  
   Uses ML to continuously analyze your **cost and usage data** and detect unusual spending (cost spikes or continuous increases).
- **No Manual Thresholds Needed:**  
   You don’t need to define any cost limits; the service automatically learns your **historical spending behavior**.
   
- **Monitors Multiple Dimensions:**
   - AWS services
   - Member accounts
   - Cost allocation tags
   - Cost categories
- **Automated Reports:**
   - Provides **Anomaly Detection Reports** with **root cause analysis** of unexpected cost changes.
- **Notifications:**
   - You can receive alerts via **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**.
   - Choose between:
       - **Individual alerts** (for each anomaly)
       - **Daily or weekly summaries**

### Benefits

- Detects cost spikes early.
- Automatically adapts to your account’s spending trends.
- Helps in **root cause analysis** to identify which service or resource caused the increase.
- Reduces the risk of unexpected AWS bills.

### Summary

AWS Cost Anomaly Detection uses machine learning to:

1. Monitor AWS costs and usage.
2. Detect anomalies automatically.
3. Send notifications through SNS.
4. Provide detailed insights into the cause of abnormal spending.


## AWS Service Quotas
---

**Definition:**

- AWS **Service Quotas** help you **manage and monitor limits** (also called _quotas_) for AWS resources and services.
- Every AWS account has **default quotas** that restrict how much of a resource you can use.

### Purpose

- Prevents accidental **resource overuse** or **cost overruns**.
- Lets you **track, get alerts, and request increases** in limits.

### Examples of Quotas

- Number of **Lambda concurrent executions**
- Number of **EC2 instances per region**
- Number of **EBS volumes**, etc.


### Key Features

- **Monitor quotas** across all AWS services.
- Create **CloudWatch Alarms** directly from the Service Quotas console:
   - Example: Get notified when Lambda concurrent executions reach 80% of the quota.
- **Request quota increases** directly from the console.
- Optionally **shut down resources** if limits are being reached unintentionally.

### Summary

- Service Quotas = Centralized place to view and manage AWS limits.
- You can:
   - **View all quotas**
   - **Get alerts** (via CloudWatch)
   - **Request increases** easily


## AWS Trusted Advisor
---

**Definition:**

### Trusted Advisor Checks (6 Categories):

1. **Cost Optimization** – Detect underused or idle resources.
2. **Performance** – Improve resource speed and efficiency.
3. **Security** – Identify risky configurations (e.g., public S3 buckets, unrestricted security groups).
4. **Fault Tolerance** – Increase application availability and resilience.
5. **Service Limits** – Warn when usage approaches AWS quota limits.
6. **Operational Excellence** – Recommend best practices for managing workloads.

### Examples of Checks

- EBS or RDS **public snapshots**
- Use of **root account**
- S3 buckets with **public access**
- **Unrestricted security group ports**
- **Lambda or EC2 limits** approaching quota

### Support Plans and Access

- **Core checks** – Available to all AWS users (basic checks).
- **Full checks** – Available only with **Business or Enterprise Support Plans**.
- With these plans, you also get **programmatic access** to Trusted Advisor through the **AWS Support API**.

### Integration and Use

- View recommendations directly in the **AWS Management Console**.
- Can view **Service Limits** (like Auto Scaling groups, DynamoDB capacity, etc.).
- Limited use without a support plan, but valuable for **security** and **service limit checks**.

### Summary

- **AWS Trusted Advisor** helps improve:
   - **Security**
   - **Cost efficiency**
   - **Performance**
   - **Reliability**
- Core checks are free, advanced checks require **Business/Enterprise support**.

- Use **AWS Control Tower** to easily set up and manage multi-account environments following best security practices.

**2. Cost and Resource Management**

- Use **Tags** and **Cost Allocation Tags** for organized resource tracking and billing.

**3. Security Best Practices**

- Follow **IAM Guidelines**:
   - Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
   - Apply **Least Privilege Principle**.
   - Enforce **Password Policies** and **Password Rotation**.
- Use a **Dedicated Logging Account** to store logs securely in S3 or CloudWatch Logs.
- Use **CloudTrail** to record all API calls for auditing.

**4. Monitoring and Compliance**

- Use **AWS Config** to track resource configurations and compliance over time.
- Use **Trusted Advisor** for account insights and optimization recommendations.

**5. Automation and Deployment**

- Use **AWS CloudFormation** to deploy stacks across multiple accounts and regions.
- Use **AWS Service Catalog** to let users launch pre-approved stacks defined by administrators.

**6. Compromised Account Recovery**
