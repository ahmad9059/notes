## AWS Databases & Analytics – Notes
---

### What is a Database?

- Stores data in a **structured way**.
- Allows **indexes** for efficient querying/searching.
- Unlike raw storage (EBS, S3, EFS, EC2 Instance Store), databases provide structure and relationships between data.

### Types of Databases

#### a. Relational Databases (SQL)

- Oldest and most common type.
- Data stored in **tables (rows & columns)** with relationships.
- Example: Students table linked to Departments table by `department_id`.
- Query language: **SQL** (Structured Query Language).
- Scaling: **Vertical (scale up)** is common, horizontal scaling is harder.

#### b. NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational)

- Stands for **Non-SQL** (not relational).
- Modern, built for **specific purposes** and **flexible schema**.
- Benefits:
   - Flexible and schema-less.
   - Scales **horizontally** (add distributed servers).
   - High performance, optimized for specific models.
- Examples:
   - Key-value stores.
   - Document stores (JSON).
   - Graph databases.
   - In-memory databases.
   - Search databases.
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) commonly used to store data.
   - Supports **nested fields, arrays, and evolving schemas**.

### AWS Shared Responsibility Model for Databases

- **Managed Databases (AWS responsibility):**
   - Quick provisioning.
   - Built-in **High Availability (HA)**.
   - Easy scaling (vertical + horizontal).
   - Automated **backups, restore, patching, upgrades**.
   - Integrated **monitoring & alerting**.
   - AWS handles **OS patching & maintenance**.
- **Self-Managed Databases (Your responsibility on EC2):**
   - You handle **resiliency, patching, backups, HA, fault tolerance, scaling**.
   - Much more operational overhead.

### Exam Tip

- For the CCP exam: **Know which AWS managed database fits which use case**.
- Example: RDS (Relational), DynamoDB (NoSQL key-value), Neptune (Graph), ElastiCache (In-memory), OpenSearch (Search).

**Key takeaway:** Use AWS **managed databases** unless explicitly required to run your own. Managed services simplify ops, scaling, backups, and patching.



## AWS Relational Databases – RDS & Aurora
---

### Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

- **Fully managed SQL databases** in AWS.
- Supports: **PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, IBM DB2, Aurora**.
- Benefits:
   - Automated **provisioning, patching, backups (Point-in-Time Restore)**.
   - **Monitoring dashboards** built-in.
   - **Read replicas** for scaling read workloads.
   - **Multi-AZ deployments** for disaster recovery.
   - **Maintenance windows** for controlled upgrades.
   - **Vertical & horizontal scaling**, storage backed by **EBS**.
- **Limitations:** You **cannot SSH** into the RDS instance.
- **Architecture fit:**
   - Load balancer → EC2 (app tier) → RDS (database tier).
   - Classic **3-tier architecture**.

- **Compatible with PostgreSQL & MySQL**.
- Benefits:
    - **Cloud optimized**.
    - Performance:
        - **5x faster than MySQL on RDS**.
        - **3x faster than PostgreSQL on RDS**.
    - **Auto-scaling storage** (in 10 GB increments, up to **128 TB**).
    - **20% more expensive than RDS**, but more **efficient & cost-effective**.
- **Exam tip:** RDS is in the Free Tier, **Aurora is NOT**.

![|715x401](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-67.webp)


### Aurora Serverless

- **Fully managed, auto-scaling Aurora**.
- No capacity planning.
- **Pay-per-second billing**.
- Scales up/down based on usage (great for **infrequent, intermittent, unpredictable workloads**).
- Client connects to **Aurora proxy fleet**, which manages DB instances automatically.
- **Exam keyword:** “Aurora with no management overhead” = **Aurora Serverless**.


![|437x423](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-66.webp)


**Exam perspective:**

- For relational DBs in AWS: **RDS & Aurora**.
- **RDS** → managed, traditional engines (Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MariaDB, DB2).
- **Aurora** → AWS-built, cloud-native, better performance, storage auto-scaling.
- **Aurora Serverless** → auto-scaling, pay-per-use, no management.


## Amazon RDS – Deployment Options
---

### Read Replicas (Scale Reads)

- Used to **scale read workloads**.
- Up to **15 read replicas** per RDS database.
- Applications can read from replicas, but **writes always go to the main DB**.
- ✅ Use Case: **Scaling read-heavy workloads**.

![|557x365](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-68.webp)

### Multi-AZ (High Availability / Failover)

- Creates a **synchronous standby copy** of the DB in another **Availability Zone**.
- Standby DB is **passive**, not for reads/writes.
- If the main DB or AZ fails, **automatic failover** happens.
- Use Case: **High Availability & Disaster Recovery within a region**.

![|560x350](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-69.webp)

### Multi-Region (Cross-Region Read Replicas)

- Deploys **read replicas across AWS regions**.
- Writes must still go to the **main region DB**.
- Benefits:
   - **Disaster recovery** if a region goes down.
   - **Low latency** for global applications (local reads).
- Extra cost for **cross-region replication & data transfer**.
- Use Cases: **Global apps, regional DR, reduced latency for remote users**.

![|715x214](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-70.webp)

### Exam Tips
- **Read Replicas** = Scale reads (not HA).
- **Multi-AZ** = High availability (not for scaling).
- **Multi-Region** = Disaster recovery + lower latency for global apps.


## Amazon ElastiCache
---

- AWS **managed in-memory database**.
- Supports **Redis** & **Memcached** engines.
- Provides **high performance, low latency** storage.
- **Exam keyword:** “in-memory database” → **ElastiCache**.

### Why use ElastiCache?

- Offloads **read-intensive workloads** from RDS or other databases.
- Stores **frequently accessed queries/results** in memory for faster access.
- Example: Repeated queries on RDS → put results in ElastiCache → reduce RDS load.

### Benefits (Managed Service)

AWS handles:

- OS maintenance & patching.
- Setup, configuration, monitoring.
- Optimizations.
- Failure recovery.
- Backups.

### Typical Architecture

- **Load Balancer → EC2 instances (ASG) → RDS**.
- Add **ElastiCache** in between for caching queries.
- RDS = slower, disk-based.
- ElastiCache = very fast, memory-based.
- Reduces **latency** and **pressure on RDS**.


![|715x347](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-71.webp)

### Exam Tips

- If you see **in-memory, cache, low latency, Redis, Memcached** → Answer is **ElastiCache**.

- Purpose: Cache **frequently read objects**.
- Latency improvement:
   - DynamoDB = ms latency.
   - DAX = **µs latency (10x faster)**.
- **Only for DynamoDB** (unlike ElastiCache, which works for many DBs).
- **Use Case:** If exam mentions _cache for DynamoDB → Answer = DAX_.


![|516x511](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-73.webp)

### DynamoDB vs Other Services (Exam Traps)

- **RDS** = relational DB.
- **ElastiCache** = caching for many DBs, general purpose.
- **DynamoDB** = serverless, NoSQL, key-value.
- **DAX** = specific cache for DynamoDB.

### Exam Keywords

- _Serverless, NoSQL, low latency, single-digit ms latency, key-value store, partition key, sort key, DAX (µs latency)_.


## DynamoDB Global Tables
---

### What are Global Tables?

- A **DynamoDB feature** for **multi-region, low-latency access**.
- Makes a table accessible in **multiple AWS regions**.
- Designed for **globally distributed applications**.

### How it works

- You create a **global table** in one region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
- Then replicate it automatically to other regions (e.g., `eu-west-3`).
- Supports **up to 10 regions**.
- Data is **two-way replicated** between regions.

![|715x269](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-74.webp)

### Key Properties

- **Read/write in any region** → not read-only.
- Data is synchronized across all regions.
- This is called **Active-Active replication**.
- Users near any region can **read/write with low latency**.

### Exam Keywords

- "Global scale", "multi-region", "low latency", "replication", "active-active" → **DynamoDB Global Tables**.
- If the scenario asks for **multi-region writes with automatic replication**, the answer is **Global Tables**.

✅ **One-liner for exam**:  
DynamoDB Global Tables = **Multi-region, active-active, low latency access with automatic replication**.
