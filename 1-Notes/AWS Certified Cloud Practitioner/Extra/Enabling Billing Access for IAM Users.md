- **Problem:** By default, IAM users (even with admin access) cannot view the **Billing and Cost Management** dashboard. They will receive an "Access Denied" error.
- **Solution:** You must enable access from the root account.
   1. Log in to your AWS account as the **Root User**.
   2. Navigate to **Account**.
   3. Scroll down to the section titled **IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information**.
   4. Click "Edit" and check the box to **Activate IAM Access**.
   5. This allows IAM users with the necessary permissions to view billing data.
### Analyzing Costs

- **Bills Page:** To understand where costs are coming from, go to the **Bills** section in the Billing console.
   
   - Select the relevant month.
   - Scroll down to **"Charges by service"** to see a detailed breakdown of costs for each AWS service (e.g., EC2, EBS, NatGateway) and the region where they were incurred.
- **Free Tier Page:** This dashboard shows your current and forecasted usage against the AWS Free Tier limits. It will warn you if you are projected to exceed the limits and incur charges.

### Creating Budget Alerts

It is highly recommended to set up budgets to get email notifications about your spending.
- **Zero Spend Budget:**
   - In the Billing console, navigate to **Budgets**.
   - Create a budget using the **"Zero spend budget"** template.
   - This will send you an email alert as soon as your account incurs any cost (i.e., spends more than $0.01).
- **Monthly Cost Budget:**
   - Create another budget using the **"Monthly cost budget"** template.
   - Set a specific monthly amount you are comfortable with (e.g., $10).
   - Configure alerts to be sent when your actual or forecasted spend reaches certain thresholds of your budget (e.g., 85% and 100%).
