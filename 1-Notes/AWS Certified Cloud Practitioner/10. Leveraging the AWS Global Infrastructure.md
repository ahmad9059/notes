## AWS Global Infrastructure
---

### Why Build a Global Application?

1. **Reduced Latency**
   * Latency = Time for a network packet to reach a server.
   * Deploying in multiple AWS Regions or Edge Locations reduces lag by placing servers closer to users.
   * Example: Users in India get faster response if an Asia region hosts the app instead of only US.
1. **Disaster Recovery (DR)**
   * Do not rely on a single Region.
   * In case of disasters (earthquake, storm, power failure, politics), failover to another Region ensures high availability.
1. **Security & Attack Resistance**

   * Spreading applications across multiple Regions makes it harder for attackers to take everything down at once.

### AWS Global Infrastructure Components

1. **Regions**
   * Geographic areas where AWS has data centers.
   * Each Region contains multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**.

2. **Availability Zones (AZs)**
   * Multiple isolated data centers within a Region.
   * Designed to be physically separate but connected with high-speed private networks.
   * Provide resilience: if one AZ fails, others remain operational.
   * Example: Northern Virginia has 6 AZs, Paris has 3 AZs.

3. **Edge Locations (Points of Presence)**
   * Locations closer to end-users for **content delivery**.
   * Cannot host apps directly but support **Amazon CloudFront (CDN)** and caching.
   * Improve speed for users even outside AWS Regions.

4. **AWS Global Network**
   * Private AWS backbone connecting Regions, AZs, and Edge Locations.
   * Includes **undersea fiber cables** for stable and high-speed interconnectivity.

### AWS Global Services (to learn in this section)

1. **Amazon Route 53** (Global DNS)
   * Routes users to the **closest deployment** with the lowest latency.
   * Supports disaster recovery and global load balancing.

2. **Amazon CloudFront** (CDN)
   * Distributes and caches content at **Edge Locations**.
   * Reduces latency and improves user experience.

3. **Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration**
   * Speeds up **global uploads/downloads** to S3 buckets using AWS Edge infrastructure.

4. **AWS Global Accelerator**
   * Improves global **application availability and performance**.
   * Uses AWS global network to route traffic optimally.

✅ **Exam Tip:**
* Regions = geographic locations.
* AZs = multiple isolated data centers per Region.
* Edge Locations = global points for caching/content delivery.
* Key global services: Route 53, CloudFront, S3 Transfer Acceleration, Global Accelerator.



## Amazon Route 53
---

### What is Route 53?

- Managed **DNS (Domain Name System)** service by AWS.
- Works like a **phone book for the internet**: maps domain names (e.g., `myapp.com`) to IP addresses or AWS resources.

### DNS Record Types in Route 53

- **A Record** → Maps domain name to IPv4 address.
- **AAAA Record** → Maps domain name to IPv6 address.
- **CNAME Record** → Maps domain name to another domain name.
- **Alias Record** (AWS-specific) → Maps domain name to AWS resources such as:
   - ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)
   - CloudFront Distribution
   - S3 Website bucket
   - RDS instance

**Exam Tip**: Alias records are AWS-only and preferred over CNAME when pointing to AWS resources.

### How DNS Resolution Works (simplified flow)

1. User enters `myapp.mydomain.com` in browser.
2. Browser queries Route 53.
3. Route 53 returns the mapped IP (from an A/AAAA record).
4. Browser connects to server at that IP.

### Route 53 Routing Policies (high-level exam focus)

1. **Simple Routing Policy**
   - Default policy.
   - Maps domain to a single resource (one IP or instance).
   - **No health checks**.
2. **Weighted Routing Policy**
   - Distributes traffic across multiple resources.
   - Example: 70% → Server A, 20% → Server B, 10% → Server C.
   - **Supports health checks** (only sends traffic to healthy resources).
   - Used for load balancing, A/B testing.

![|715x384](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-101.webp)


1. **Latency Routing Policy**
   - Routes traffic to the resource with the **lowest latency** (closest AWS Region).
   - Example: User in Asia → Asia Region, User in US → US Region.
   - Improves performance globally.
2. **Failover Routing Policy**
   - Primary and secondary setup.
   - Route 53 checks health of primary.
   - If primary fails, traffic is sent to secondary.
   - Supports **Disaster Recovery** scenarios.


![|715x372](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-102.webp)

### Key Exam Takeaways

- Route 53 = Managed DNS by AWS.
- Alias records = special AWS integration.
- Simple = no health checks.
- Weighted = traffic split.
- Latency = best performance.
- Failover = disaster recovery.


## Amazon CloudFront – Exam Notes
---

### What is CloudFront?

- AWS’s **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**.
- Improves **read performance** by caching content at **Edge Locations**.
- Anytime you see **CDN** in the exam, think **CloudFront**.

### Key Benefits

1. **Low Latency**
   - Content cached at ~216+ Points of Presence (Edge Locations).
   - Users get data from nearest Edge instead of origin → better performance.
2. **Global Distribution**
   - Content available worldwide without setting up multiple servers.
3. **DDoS Protection**
   - Spreading content globally protects against large-scale attacks.
   - Integrated with **AWS Shield** and **WAF** (Web Application Firewall).

### How CloudFront Works

- User request goes to nearest Edge Location.
- If content is cached → served immediately.
- If not cached → CloudFront fetches from **Origin**, caches it, then serves.

### S3 as an Orgin

![|715x417](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-104.webp)

### Origins Supported by CloudFront

1. **Amazon S3**
   - For static files.
   - Secured via **OAC (Origin Access Control)** and bucket policy.
2. **VPC Origins**
   - Example: Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or EC2 in private subnet.
   - CloudFront can connect privately.
3. **Custom Origins**
   - Any **HTTP backend** (inside or outside AWS).
   - Example: S3 static website hosting, on-premise HTTP server.

### CloudFront vs S3 Cross-Region Replication

| Feature  | CloudFront (CDN)                       | S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose  | Cache content at global Edge Locations | Replicate full S3 bucket to another Region |
| Coverage | 216+ Edge Locations worldwide          | Only Regions you configure                 |
| Updates  | Cached for a short TTL (e.g., 1 day)   | Near real-time replication                 |
| Best For | Static content, global distribution    | Dynamic content, redundancy across Regions |
| Caching  | Yes                                    | No                                         |


### Exam Tips

- CloudFront = CDN, caching at Edges.
- OAC used to secure S3 origin.
- Works with S3, ALB/NLB, EC2, or any HTTP server.
- CloudFront ≠ S3 replication, they solve different problems.


## S3 Transfer Acceleration
---

### Problem

- **S3 Buckets are regional** (linked to one Region).
- Uploading files from distant locations (e.g., USA → S3 bucket in Australia) can be **slow**.

### What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?

- A feature that **speeds up uploads and downloads** to S3 buckets across large distances.
- Uses **Amazon CloudFront Edge Locations** as entry points.
- Data travels through AWS’s **internal optimized network** instead of the public internet.

### How it Works

1. User uploads file to **nearest Edge Location**.
2. File is routed through **AWS private backbone network**.
3. Delivered to the **destination S3 bucket** in another Region.
4. Works for both **uploads** and **downloads**.

### Key Points

- Best when bucket is **far from users**.
- Performance improvement depends on **distance and internet quality**.
- Typical gains range from **10% to much higher**, depending on Region and location.
- AWS provides a **test tool** to compare standard vs accelerated transfer speeds.
- Use when you have a **global application** that needs to centralize uploads/downloads to one bucket.

### Example

- Uploading from **USA → S3 in Australia**:
   - Without acceleration → slow, unreliable.
   - With acceleration → user uploads to US Edge → transferred internally to Australia.

### Exam Tips

- **Transfer Acceleration ≠ Cross-Region Replication**.
   - Transfer Acceleration = speed up data movement into/out of S3.
   - CRR = copy data between buckets in different Regions.
- Often tested with scenario like: _“Users worldwide upload to a single bucket in Region X, how to speed it up?”_ → **Answer: Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration**.


## AWS Global Accelerator
---

### Purpose

- Improves **global application availability and performance**.
- Uses the **AWS global private network** instead of the unpredictable public internet.
- Optimizes request routing, giving up to **60% faster performance**.

### How It Works

1. Users connect to the **nearest AWS Edge Location**.
2. From there, traffic is routed over the **AWS private backbone network** to the target region/application.
3. This reduces latency and improves reliability compared to normal internet routing.

### Benefits

- **Faster performance** (shorter internet hops, then private AWS backbone).
- **High availability** with automatic rerouting.
- **DDoS protection** integrated with AWS Shield.
- **Two static Anycast IPs** (fixed entry points for your app, instead of changing regional endpoints).
- **Global failover**: if one region is down, traffic automatically routes to another.

### Example Scenario

- App is hosted in **India**.
- Users in US, Europe, and Australia access it.
- Without Global Accelerator: traffic crosses many internet hops (high latency, possible failures).
- With Global Accelerator:
   - User connects to the **nearest edge location** (US, Europe, Australia).
   - Traffic flows via AWS private network to India.
   - Result: lower latency, more reliable connections.

### Key Difference: Global Accelerator vs CloudFront

| Feature        | **Global Accelerator**                                                  | **CloudFront**                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use case**   | Improves speed and reliability of **all application traffic** (TCP/UDP) | **Content delivery network (CDN)** – caches static content at edge     |
| **Caching**    | No caching, traffic goes back to origin                                 | Caches content at edge for faster delivery                             |
| **Protocols**  | Supports TCP & UDP (HTTP, gaming, VoIP, APIs)                           | Mainly HTTP/HTTPS                                                      |
| **IP Address** | Provides **2 static Anycast IPs** for global access                     | Uses dynamic CloudFront URLs or custom domain                          |
| **Failover**   | Fast regional failover for high availability                            | Focused on cached content, not failover                                |
| **Best for**   | Global apps needing **low latency, static IPs, fast failover**          | Serving **static/dynamic cached content** like images, video, websites |

### Real Performance Test (from transcript)

- Northern Virginia: 23% faster.
- Oregon: 31% faster.
- Singapore: 34% faster.
- Sydney: 53% faster.
- Ireland/Frankfurt (close regions): same performance (no real gain, since internet already short).

### Exam Tips

- Use **Global Accelerator** when:
   - You need **static IPs** for global clients.
   - You want **low latency and high availability** for global users.
   - You need **regional failover** for disaster recovery.
- Use **CloudFront** when:
   - You want to **cache content** at the edge.
   - Optimizing for **static/dynamic content delivery** like media files and websites.

**Key takeaway**: **Global Accelerator = faster routing & failover via AWS global network.**  
**CloudFront = caching content at the edge (CDN).**


## AWS Outposts
---

### What is Hybrid Cloud?

- **Hybrid Cloud** = Using both **on-premises infrastructure** and **cloud infrastructure** together.
- This means managing **two environments**:
   - Cloud (AWS console, CLI, APIs)
   - On-premises (local servers, physical infrastructure)
- Leads to **different skillsets**, **different APIs**, and added **complexity**.

### AWS Outposts Overview

- **AWS Outposts** is a **fully managed service** that brings **AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools** **on-premises**.
- In simple words, AWS installs **server racks (Outposts racks)** **inside your data center**.
- These racks run **the same AWS hardware and software** as used in AWS data centers.
- You manage them **through the same AWS Console, CLI, or APIs**—no difference.

### How It Works

1. AWS delivers and installs **Outposts racks** at your site.
2. The racks are **owned and managed by AWS**, but **physically located** in your data center.
3. You can then **launch AWS services locally** on those racks.
4. You still manage everything using **AWS tools** (Console, CLI, SDKs, etc.).

### Services Supported on Outposts

You can run the following AWS services **locally**:

- **Amazon EC2** (compute instances)
- **Amazon EBS** (block storage)
- **Amazon S3** (object storage)
- **Amazon RDS** (databases)
- **Amazon EKS** and **ECS** (containers)
- **Amazon EMR** (big data processing)

### Use Cases

- Applications requiring **low-latency** access to on-premises systems.
- **Data residency** requirements (legal or compliance).
- Industries like **finance, healthcare, or manufacturing** that need local processing.
- **Gradual cloud migration** (step-by-step move to AWS).

### Exam Tip

- **Outposts = AWS Cloud inside your data center.**
- Fully managed, same APIs and services as AWS Cloud.
- Used when you need **low latency, local data processing, or data residency**.
- You are responsible for **physical security** of Outposts racks.

### Summary Table

| Feature                     | **AWS Outposts**                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**                    | Hybrid cloud solution                                             |
| **Managed by**              | AWS (hardware & software)                                         |
| **Location**                | Customer’s on-premises data center                                |
| **APIs/Tools**              | Same as AWS Cloud                                                 |
| **Latency**                 | Very low (local access)                                           |
| **Data Residency**          | Data stays on-premises                                            |
| **Customer Responsibility** | Physical security                                                 |
| **Use Cases**               | Low latency apps, local processing, compliance, gradual migration |


**Key takeaway:** **AWS Outposts brings AWS services, APIs, and infrastructure directly into your on-premises data center, providing the same experience as the AWS Cloud but with local control and low latency.**


## AWS Wavelength
---

### What is AWS Wavelength?

- **AWS Wavelength Zones** are **AWS infrastructure deployments** embedded inside **telecommunication providers’ data centers** at the **edge of 5G networks**.
- Purpose: To **bring AWS services closer to end-users** and provide **ultra-low latency** for 5G applications.

### How it Works

- You can **deploy AWS resources (EC2, EBS, VPC, etc.)** directly into **Wavelength Zones**.
- These zones are **connected to 5G networks** via **carrier gateways**.
- End-users on 5G access applications **with extremely low latency** because the compute resources are **physically near the users**.
- The traffic often **stays within the telecom provider’s network (CSP)** and **does not reach the AWS region** unless needed.


![|263x312](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-108.webp)

### Connectivity

- **Wavelength Zones** are **connected to their parent AWS Region**.
   - Example: EC2 in Wavelength Zone can access **RDS or DynamoDB** in the parent region.
- **No extra charges or agreements** are required to use Wavelength.

### Benefits

- **Ultra-low latency** for 5G apps.
- **Edge computing** capabilities with AWS tools.
- **Local data processing** without sending traffic to AWS cloud.
- **Seamless integration** with AWS regions when needed.

### Use Cases

- **Smart cities**
- **Machine Learning-assisted diagnostics**
- **Connected vehicles**
- **Interactive live video streaming**
- **Augmented Reality (AR) / Virtual Reality (VR)**
- **Real-time gaming**

### Exam Tip

Whenever the question mentions **“5G” or “ultra-low latency edge computing”**, the correct answer is **AWS Wavelength**.


## AWS Local Zones
---

### What is AWS Local Zones?

- **Local Zones** extend AWS Regions **closer to end users** to run **latency-sensitive applications**.
- They place **compute, storage, database, and other AWS services** physically near large population or industrial centers.
- Think of them as **mini extensions of an AWS Region** located in different cities.


### How It Works

- Each **Local Zone** is an **extension of a specific AWS Region**.
- You can **extend your VPC** from the region into one or more Local Zones.
- You can then **launch AWS resources (like EC2, RDS, ECS, EBS, etc.)** directly in the Local Zone.
- Example:
    - Region: **us-east-1 (Northern Virginia)**
    - Local Zones: **Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Houston**, etc.
- These local zones are **connected** to their parent region through **high-bandwidth private AWS network links**.

![|407x462](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-109.webp)

### Key Features

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Run apps that need **single-digit millisecond latency** near end-users.|
|**Parent Region**|Each local zone is **tied to one AWS Region**.|
|**Supported Services**|EC2, EBS, RDS, ECS, ElastiCache, Direct Connect, etc.|
|**Networking**|Extend **VPC** to Local Zone; create subnets in those zones.|
|**Management**|Local Zones must be **enabled manually** in the AWS console.|
|**Name Format**|Example: `us-east-1-bos-1a` (Boston Local Zone).|

### Example from Hands-On

1. Go to **EC2 Console** → pick a region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
2. Under **Settings → Zones**, enable a Local Zone (like **Boston**).
3. Create a **subnet** for that Local Zone (e.g., `Boston Subnet`).
4. Launch an **EC2 instance** and select the **Boston Local Zone subnet**.
5. This places compute **physically closer** to users in Boston.

### Benefits

- **Lower latency** for users far from AWS Regions.
- **Improved performance** for real-time applications.
- **No need to build your own edge infrastructure**.
- **Integrated with AWS ecosystem** (VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, etc.).

### Exam Tip

If the question says:

- “Run applications with **ultra-low latency** for users in a specific city.”
- “Need AWS services close to **end-users**, but not inside a 5G network.”

The answer is **AWS Local Zones**.

_(If the question mentions **5G or telecom edge**, that’s **AWS Wavelength** instead.)_



## Global Application Architectures in AWS

| **Setup**                  | One EC2 instance in one AZ in one region                 |
| **High Availability (HA)** | ❌ No — single point of failure                           |
| **Global Reach**           | ❌ Poor — users far from the region face **high latency** |
| **Difficulty Level**       | ⭐ Very simple                                            |
| **Use Case**               | Testing, development, or non-critical workloads          |

![|472x442](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-110.webp)

### Single Region, Multi-AZ

|Aspect|Description|
|---|---|
|**Setup**|EC2 instances (and other resources) in multiple AZs within the same region|
|**High Availability (HA)**|✅ Yes — because of **redundancy across AZs**|
|**Global Reach**|❌ No — still serves users from one region only|
|**Difficulty Level**|⭐⭐ Slightly increased|
|**Use Case**|Production workloads needing fault tolerance within one region|

![|454x444](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-111.webp)

### Multi-Region, **Active–Passive**

|Aspect|Description|
|---|---|
|**Setup**|Two or more regions, one is **active**, others are **passive**|
|**Data Replication**|✅ Data replicated from active → passive regions|
|**Reads/Writes**|Reads may happen from passive, but **writes only allowed in active** region|
|**Latency**|✅ Better read latency (data closer to users), ❌ Writes still go to one region|
|**Difficulty Level**|⭐⭐⭐ Moderate — requires replication and failover setup|
|**Example**|Backup/DR setups, S3 cross-region replication, RDS read replicas|
|**Failover Behavior**|If active region fails → passive becomes active|
|**Use Case**|Disaster Recovery (DR) or read-heavy global workloads|

![|485x438](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-112.webp)

### Multi-Region, **Active–Active**

|Aspect|Description|
|---|---|
|**Setup**|Multiple regions, each region is **fully active**|
|**Data Replication**|✅ Bidirectional — data synchronized across all regions|
|**Reads/Writes**|✅ Both reads and writes in all regions|
|**Latency**|✅ Lowest for both reads and writes globally|
|**Difficulty Level**|⭐⭐⭐⭐ High — complex synchronization logic needed|
|**Example**|DynamoDB Global Tables, Route 53 latency-based routing, global web apps|
|**Use Case**|Mission-critical applications needing **global low-latency** and **no single point of failure**|

![|475x440](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-113.webp)

### Summary Table

|Architecture Type|Regions Used|Availability|Read Latency|Write Latency|Difficulty|Example Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Single Region, Single AZ|1|❌ Low|❌ High for global|❌ High|⭐|Dev/Test|
|Single Region, Multi-AZ|1|✅ High|❌ High for global|❌ High|⭐⭐|Production app (one region)|
|Multi-Region Active–Passive|2+|✅ Very High|✅ Improved|❌ Centralized|⭐⭐⭐|Disaster Recovery|
|Multi-Region Active–Active|2+|✅✅ Excellent|✅✅ Global|✅✅ Global|⭐⭐⭐⭐|Global scale apps|

### AWS Example Services

|Example|Type|
|---|---|
|**S3 Cross-Region Replication**|Active–Passive|
|**RDS Read Replicas**|Active–Passive|
|**DynamoDB Global Tables**|Active–Active|
|**Route 53 Latency Routing**|Helps Active–Active setups|


### Exam Tip

If the question says:

- “**Users across the world** should have **low latency** for both reads and writes.” → ✅ **Active–Active**
- “**Disaster recovery** setup, passive region acts as backup.” → ✅ **Active–Passive**
- “**Single region fault tolerance** only.” → ✅ **Single Region Multi-AZ**
