## VPC & Networking (Overview)
---

### What is a VPC?

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a **private, isolated section** of the AWS cloud where you can launch and manage your AWS resources (like EC2, RDS, etc.).
- It provides **control over networking**, including IP addressing, subnets, routing, and security.
- Think of it as your own **virtual data center** in AWS.

### Why VPC Matters

- VPC concepts are essential for networking-related AWS services.
- **In-depth knowledge** is required for advanced certifications such as:
   - AWS Certified **Solutions Architect – Associate**
   - AWS Certified **SysOps Administrator – Associate**
- For **CCP**, understanding **high-level concepts** and their **purpose** is sufficient.

### Key Components to Know (for CCP)

|**Component**|**Purpose / Function**|
|---|---|
|**VPC**|The virtual private network environment in AWS.|
|**Subnets**|Divide a VPC into smaller networks; can be **public** (internet-accessible) or **private**.|
|**Internet Gateway (IGW)**|Allows communication between resources in a **public subnet** and the **internet**.|
|**NAT Gateway**|Enables **outbound internet access** for **private subnets** without exposing them publicly.|
|**Security Groups**|Act as **stateful firewalls** controlling inbound and outbound traffic **at the instance level**.|
|**Network ACLs (NACLs)**|**Stateless firewalls** controlling traffic **at the subnet level**.|
|**VPC Flow Logs**|Capture **network traffic information** for monitoring and troubleshooting.|
|**VPC Peering**|Connects **two VPCs privately** using AWS’s internal network.|
|**VPC Endpoints**|Enable **private connectivity** to AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB) without using the internet.|
|**Site-to-Site VPN**|Connects an **on-premises network** to a **VPC** over the internet securely.|
|**Direct Connect**|Establishes a **dedicated physical connection** between on-premises and AWS for low latency.|
|**Transit Gateway**|Central hub to **connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks** efficiently.|

### CCP Exam Relevance

- The **VPC topic** accounts for **less than 1–2 questions** on the exam.
- Focus on **definitions, purposes, and relationships** between components.
- Hands-on familiarity with the **default VPC** (created automatically by AWS) is helpful.

### Key Takeaways

- Understand what each component **does** and **why it’s used**.
- No need to configure or design a VPC for the CCP level.
- Exam tests **conceptual clarity**, not technical implementation.



## IP Addresses in AWS
---

### IPv4 Overview

- **IPv4** (Internet Protocol version 4) provides around **4.3 billion unique addresses**.
- Common format: `192.0.2.1` (four octets).
- Used for **most existing networks and devices**.

### Public IPv4

- **Public IPs** are **reachable over the internet**.
- Assigned automatically when creating EC2 instances (if enabled).
- **Behavior**:
   - Released when instance is **stopped**.
   - A **new public IP** is assigned when instance is **started again**.
- **Pricing**:
   - AWS charges **$0.005/hour** per public IPv4 address (including Elastic IPs).
   - **Free Tier**: 750 hours of public IPv4 usage per month.

### Private IPv4

- Used for **internal communication** within private networks (e.g., inside a VPC).
- Example range: `192.168.0.0/16`.
- **Not accessible from the internet**.
- **Remains the same** for an EC2 instance’s entire lifetime, even after stop/start.

### Elastic IP (EIP)

- A **static public IPv4 address** that remains the same even if an instance is stopped and restarted.
- Useful for **consistent IP mapping** (e.g., DNS records).
- **Charged** if allocated but **not associated** with a running instance.

### IPv6 Overview

- **IPv6** (Internet Protocol version 6) is the **newer protocol** with **3.4 × 10³⁸ addresses** (virtually unlimited).
- Example format: `2600:1f18:abcd:1234::1`.
- **All IPv6 addresses are public** (no private range).
- **Free to use** in AWS (no hourly charge).

### IPv4 vs IPv6 (Quick Comparison)

|Feature|**IPv4**|**IPv6**|
|---|---|---|
|Address Space|4.3 billion|3.4 × 10³⁸|
|Format|4 decimal octets (e.g., 192.168.0.1)|Hexadecimal blocks (e.g., 2600:1f18::1)|
|Private Range|Yes|No|
|Internet Reachability|Optional|Always Public|
|AWS Cost|$0.005/hour|Free|
|Example Usage|Legacy systems, internal networking|New apps, scalable internet exposure|

### Exam Tip

- Know the difference between **public**, **private**, and **elastic** IPs.
- Remember: **IPv6 = free + public-only + huge address space**.
- For CCP, focus on **behavior and cost**, not configuration details.



## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Overview
---

### Definition

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a **private, isolated network** in AWS used to **deploy cloud resources** like EC2 instances, databases, etc.
- Each **VPC is region-specific**.
   - If you use multiple AWS Regions, you have **separate VPCs** in each region.

### VPC Structure

- A VPC contains **subnets**, which are **partitions** of the VPC network.
- Each **subnet** is associated with **one Availability Zone (AZ)**.
- **CIDR Range (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** defines the **IP address range** of a VPC. Example: `10.0.0.0/16`.

![|307x402](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-133.webp)
### Subnets

| **Type**           | **Description**                                                                             | **Typical Use**                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public Subnet**  | Has direct access to the internet through an **Internet Gateway (IGW)**.                    | EC2 instances that need to be reachable from the internet, Load Balancers. |
| **Private Subnet** | **No direct access** from the internet. Can still access the internet indirectly (via NAT). | Databases, backend servers, internal applications.                         |

- **Subnets are made public** when their route tables include a route to an Internet Gateway.


![|715x408](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-132.webp)


### Route Tables

- **Route Tables** define how traffic flows **between subnets** and **to external networks**.
- **Public subnet route** → Internet Gateway (IGW).
- **Private subnet route** → NAT Gateway or NAT Instance (for outbound internet access).

### Internet Gateway (IGW)

- A **managed AWS component** that allows communication **between VPC and the internet**.
- Must be **attached to a VPC**.
- Used by **public subnets** for inbound/outbound internet access.


![|359x406](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-134.webp)


### NAT Gateway / NAT Instance

|**Feature**|**NAT Gateway (Managed)**|**NAT Instance (Self-managed)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Allows **private subnet instances** to access the internet **outbound only**.|Same purpose, but requires user maintenance.|
|**Location**|Must be in a **public subnet**.|Must be in a **public subnet**.|
|**Inbound Access**|Not allowed from the internet.|Not allowed (by default).|
|**Use Case**|Update servers, download patches, access external APIs.|Custom configurations.|

**Flow Example:**  
Private subnet → NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway → Internet

### Multi-AZ VPC Example

- Example layout:
   - **Region** → contains one **VPC**
   - **VPC** → spans **two AZs**
   - **Each AZ** → has one **public** and one **private** subnet
   - **Total:** 1 VPC, 2 AZs, 4 Subnets (2 public + 2 private)
- EC2 instances can be deployed in any subnet.

### Key Exam Tips

- **VPC = isolated private network in AWS.**
- **Public subnet = has route to Internet Gateway.**
- **Private subnet = no direct internet route.**
- **NAT Gateway = outbound internet for private subnets only.**
- **Internet Gateway = inbound/outbound internet access for public subnets.**
- **VPCs are region-scoped**, **subnets are AZ-scoped**.



## Network Security in VPC
---

### Two Main Security Layers

1. **Network ACL (NACL)** — subnet-level firewall
2. **Security Group (SG)** — instance-level firewall

These work **together** to secure traffic _to and from_ your EC2 instances inside a VPC.

### Network ACL (NACL)

#### Definition

- A **firewall that operates at the subnet level**.
- Controls **inbound and outbound traffic** for subnets.
- Rules are **evaluated in order**, starting from the lowest rule number.

#### Characteristics

|**Feature**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Scope**|Subnet-level|
|**Rules**|Can **ALLOW** or **DENY** traffic|
|**Direction**|Separate inbound and outbound rules|
|**Statefulness**|**Stateless** — return traffic must be explicitly allowed|
|**Default NACL**|Allows all inbound and outbound traffic|
|**Custom NACLs**|Start with _DENY ALL_ rules (must explicitly allow)|
|**Rules use**|Only **IP addresses** (no SG references)|

#### Example

- A subnet has a NACL allowing only **HTTPS (443)** inbound and outbound.
- All other ports/traffic are **denied** by default.

#### Exam Tip

- **NACL = stateless, subnet-level, can ALLOW or DENY.**

### Security Groups (SG)

#### **Definition**

- A **firewall that operates at the instance level (ENI level)**.
- Controls traffic **to and from EC2 instances**.

#### Characteristics

|**Feature**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Scope**|Instance-level|
|**Rules**|**ALLOW only** (no DENY rules)|
|**Direction**|Separate inbound and outbound rules|
|**Statefulness**|**Stateful** — return traffic automatically allowed|
|**References**|Can reference **IP addresses** or **other security groups**|
|**Default SG**|Allows **no inbound**, but **all outbound** traffic|

#### Example

- Allow inbound **SSH (22)** from your IP.
- Allow inbound **HTTP (80)** from anywhere.
- Automatically allows responses (stateful).

#### Exam Tip

- **Security Group = stateful, instance-level, ALLOW-only.**

### NACL vs Security Group (Comparison)

|**Feature**|**Network ACL (NACL)**|**Security Group (SG)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Scope**|Subnet-level|Instance-level|
|**Rules**|ALLOW & DENY|ALLOW only|
|**Statefulness**|Stateless|Stateful|
|**Return Traffic**|Must be explicitly allowed|Automatically allowed|
|**References**|IP addresses only|IPs or other SGs|
|**Default Behavior**|Allows all|Denies all inbound, allows all outbound|

![|261x329](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-135.webp)


### Default Behavior in AWS

- Every **VPC** automatically comes with a **default NACL** and **default SG**.
- **Default NACL** → allows **all inbound/outbound traffic**.
- **Default SG** → allows **all outbound**, **no inbound** unless specified.

### Practical Example (from AWS Console)

- Navigate to **VPC > Security > Security Groups** to view existing groups.
- Each SG shows its **inbound and outbound rules**.
- Navigate to **VPC > Security > Network ACLs** to view subnet-level ACLs.
- Each NACL is associated with one or more **subnets**.

### Summary for Exam

 **NACL** → subnet-level, ALLOW/DENY, stateless, IP-based  
 **Security Group** → instance-level, ALLOW-only, stateful, can reference SGs  
 **Return traffic** → automatic for SG, manual for NACL  
 **Default NACL** → allows all, **Default SG** → allows outbound only


## VPC Flow Logs
---

**Definition:**  
VPC Flow Logs capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

**Levels of Flow Logs:**

- **VPC Flow Log** (entire VPC)
- **Subnet Flow Log** (specific subnet)
- **ENI Flow Log** (specific Elastic Network Interface, e.g., EC2)

**Purpose:**

- Monitor and troubleshoot connectivity issues:
   - Subnet not connecting to the Internet
   - Subnet-to-subnet connectivity problems
   - Internet unable to reach a subnet
- Analyze traffic for EC2, Load Balancers, RDS, Aurora, ElastiCache, etc.

**Destinations (where logs are sent):**

- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**
- **Amazon S3**
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**

**Configuration Options:**

- **Filter:**
   - All traffic
   - Accepted traffic
   - Rejected traffic
- **Aggregation Interval:**
   - 1 minute or 10 minutes
- **Log Format Fields:**  
   Version, Account ID, Interface ID, Source & Destination IPs, Ports, Protocol, Packets, Bytes, Start/End time, Action, Log status

### VPC Peering

**Definition:**  
VPC Peering allows two VPCs to communicate privately using AWS’s internal network.

**Behavior:**

- The two VPCs behave as if they are part of the same network.
- Useful for interconnecting workloads across different VPCs, accounts, or regions.

**Key Rules:**

1. **No overlapping CIDR blocks** allowed between the VPCs.
2. **Not transitive:**
   - If A↔B and A↔C are connected, **B and C cannot talk** unless you also create **B↔C** peering.
3. **Traffic routing:**
   - Update route tables in both VPCs to allow communication.

**Cross-region / cross-account peering:**  
Possible between VPCs in the same or different regions/accounts (requires acceptance by the other VPC owner).


![|350](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-136.webp)

### Exam Tips

- **Flow Logs** = Monitor traffic, find connectivity issues.
- **Peering** = Private connection between non-overlapping VPCs, not transitive.
- **Flow Logs destinations** = S3, CloudWatch, Firehose.
- **Flow Logs levels** = VPC, Subnet, ENI.



## VPC Endpoints (Private Access to AWS Services)
---

#### **Concept**

- Normally, AWS services are accessed **publicly** via the internet.
- **VPC Endpoints** allow **private access** to AWS services within the **AWS network**, avoiding the public internet.

#### **Benefits**

-  **Better Security** – no public internet exposure.
-  **Lower Latency** – traffic stays within the AWS backbone.

### Types of VPC Endpoints

#### Gateway Endpoint

- Used **only** for:
   - **Amazon S3**
   - **Amazon DynamoDB**
- Traffic to these services flows privately through the **gateway**.
- **Configured at the route table level** of your VPC/subnet.

🗝️ **Remember:**  
👉 _Gateway Endpoint = S3 + DynamoDB only_

#### Interface Endpoint (PrivateLink)

- Used for **most other AWS services**, for example:
   - CloudWatch
   - EC2
   - SSM
   - SNS, SQS, etc.
- Creates an **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)** in your subnet that connects privately to the service.

🗝️ **Remember:**  
👉 _Interface Endpoint = For all other services (via PrivateLink)_

### Configuration Overview

1. Go to **VPC Console → Endpoints → Create Endpoint**
2. Choose:
   - **Service Type:** AWS services
   - **Service Name:** e.g., S3, CloudWatch
3. Select:
   - **VPC**
   - **Subnet(s)** (for interface endpoint)
   - **Route Table(s)** (for gateway endpoint)
4. Define **policy**, **security groups**, and **DNS settings** if needed.


![|400](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-137.webp)

### Exam Tips

- Only **S3** and **DynamoDB** support **Gateway Endpoints**.
- All other services use **Interface Endpoints (PrivateLink)**.
- VPC endpoints improve **security** and **performance**.
- **No need for Internet Gateway (IGW)**, **NAT Gateway**, or **VPN** to access AWS services privately.



## AWS PrivateLink
---

### Definition

AWS PrivateLink enables **private connectivity** between **VPCs**, **AWS services**, or **third-party services** **without using the public internet**.

It is part of the **VPC Endpoint Services** family.

### Purpose

- Provides **secure, private communication** over the **AWS internal network**.
- Replaces **VPC peering** for scalable, secure, and simple service sharing.
- Commonly used by **vendors (SaaS providers)** or **marketplace services** to expose applications privately to customers.

### How It Works

1. **Service Provider (Vendor side)**
   - Hosts a service in their **own VPC**.
   - Creates a **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** to expose the service.
   - Enables it as a **VPC Endpoint Service**.
2. **Service Consumer (Customer side)**
   - Creates an **Interface Endpoint (Elastic Network Interface)** in their own VPC.
   - Connects privately to the vendor’s service through **PrivateLink**.
3. **Traffic Path:**
   - Communication stays **within AWS’s private network** (no public internet, NAT, or VPN).


![|715x268](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-138.webp)

### Key Benefits

 No exposure to the public internet  
 Simplified network management  
 Highly scalable (each new customer just creates a new endpoint)  
 Reduced complexity compared to VPC peering

### Exam Tips

- **PrivateLink** connects **VPCs privately** via **Network Load Balancers**.
- **VPC Peering** connects entire VPCs (non-scalable and not private by default).
- **PrivateLink** = secure, private access to a service across VPCs/accounts/regions.
- Traffic never leaves the **AWS internal network**.



## Hybrid Cloud Connectivity
---

Hybrid Cloud = Connecting **on-premises data center** with **AWS Cloud (VPC)**.
There are **two main options** for hybrid connectivity:

1. **Site-to-Site VPN**
2. **AWS Direct Connect (DX)**

### Site-to-Site VPN

**Definition:**  
Encrypted connection between **on-premises data center** and **AWS VPC** over the **public internet**.

**Features:**

- Encrypted IPsec tunnel
- Uses **public internet**
- Quick to set up (~5 minutes)
- Lower cost, but **less reliable** and **limited bandwidth**


![|715x319](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-139.webp)


**Use Case:**  
Temporary or quick connection setup between on-premises and AWS.

**Components:**

- **Customer Gateway (CGW):** On-premises side
- **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW):** AWS side

**Exam Tip:**  
🧠 _To establish Site-to-Site VPN, you need CGW (customer) + VGW (AWS)._

### AWS Direct Connect (DX)

**Definition:**  
A **dedicated private physical connection** between **on-premises** and **AWS**.

**Features:**

- Traffic flows **over private AWS network** (not public internet)
- **High bandwidth**, **low latency**, **secure**, **reliable**
- More expensive and takes **weeks (≈1 month)** to set up
- Requires connection through **Direct Connect partner**

![|287x240](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-140.webp)


**Use Case:**  
When you need **consistent performance**, **high data transfer**, or **private link**.

### Comparison: Site-to-Site VPN vs Direct Connect

|Feature|Site-to-Site VPN|Direct Connect|
|---|---|---|
|**Connection Type**|Encrypted over Public Internet|Private Physical Connection|
|**Setup Time**|Minutes|Weeks|
|**Cost**|Low|High|
|**Speed/Bandwidth**|Limited|High|
|**Reliability**|Medium|Very High|
|**Security**|Encrypted but public|Private and secure|
|**Use Case**|Quick setup, backup|Long-term, high performance|

### 🧾 **Exam Summary**

- Hybrid cloud = On-premises + AWS VPC
- **Site-to-Site VPN** → Fast, cheap, encrypted, public internet
- **Direct Connect (DX)** → Slow to set up, private, fast, reliable
- **VPN needs:** CGW + VGW
- Choose **VPN** for quick setup or temporary use
- Choose **DX** for secure, high-performance, private connections


## AWS Client VPN
---

### Definition

AWS **Client VPN** is a **managed, scalable VPN service** that allows individual **users (clients)** to securely connect from their computers to **AWS VPC** or **on-premises networks** using **OpenVPN protocol**.

### Purpose / Use Case

- Allows a user’s **computer** to securely connect to a **private VPC** over the **public internet**.
- Enables access to **private resources** (like EC2 instances in private subnets) **using private IPs**.
- Useful for developers, admins, or remote employees who need **secure access** to internal AWS networks.

### How It Works

1. The **Client VPN software** (OpenVPN-based) is installed on the user’s computer.
2. The connection is established **over the public internet** to **AWS Client VPN endpoint**.
3. Once connected, the user’s machine behaves as if it is **inside the VPC**.
4. The user can access **EC2 instances** or other private resources **using private IPs**.
5. If the VPC is also connected to **on-premises data center** (via Site-to-Site VPN),  
   → the user can securely access **on-prem servers** as well.


![|715x210](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-141.webp)

### Key Points for Exam

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Protocol Used**|OpenVPN|
|**Connection Type**|Over public internet (encrypted)|
|**Access Level**|Individual user-level (client)|
|**Main Benefit**|Secure remote access to private AWS or on-prem networks|
|**Integrates With**|VPC and optionally Site-to-Site VPN for hybrid access|

### Summary

- **Site-to-Site VPN** → Connects **networks** (on-prem to AWS).
- **Client VPN** → Connects **individual users** (laptops/desktops) to AWS.
- Enables private access without exposing resources to the public internet.


## AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)
---
### Definition

AWS **Transit Gateway** is a **central hub** that allows you to connect **multiple VPCs**, **on-premises networks**, and **VPNs** together in a **hub-and-spoke** model.

It simplifies complex network topologies and replaces the need for multiple VPC peering connections.

### Why It Exists

- When you have **many VPCs** and **on-premises connections**, managing **individual peering links** and **routing tables** becomes messy.
- Transit Gateway provides a **single, centralized gateway** to manage and route traffic between all networks.

### How It Works

- All VPCs, **Direct Connect Gateways**, and **Site-to-Site VPNs** connect to **one Transit Gateway**.
- The TGW acts as a **hub**, and each VPC acts as a **spoke** in the topology.
- **No need for VPC peering** between every pair of VPCs.
- Simplifies routing and scales to **thousands of VPCs**.

### Supports

 Amazon VPCs  
 VPN connections  
 AWS Direct Connect Gateways  
 On-premises networks


![|419x380](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-142.webp)

### Exam Tip

|Scenario|AWS Service|
|---|---|
|Connect 2 VPCs directly|**VPC Peering**|
|Connect On-premises to AWS over internet|**Site-to-Site VPN**|
|Connect On-premises to AWS privately|**Direct Connect**|
|Connect many VPCs and on-prem together (hub-and-spoke)|**Transit Gateway**|

### Key Benefits

- Centralized network management
- Scalable and simplified routing
- Integration with hybrid architectures
- Works across multiple AWS accounts

### Summary

> **Transit Gateway = “Network Hub” for multi-VPC and hybrid connections**  
> If you see **hundreds or thousands of VPCs + on-premises systems**, the correct answer is **Transit Gateway**.



## Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Summary
---

### Core Concepts

- **VPC** stands for **Virtual Private Cloud** — your **isolated private network** within AWS.
- **Subnet**: a subdivision of your VPC, tied to a **specific Availability Zone**.

### Internet Connectivity

- To allow **internet access** → attach an **Internet Gateway (IGW)** to your VPC.
- **Private instances** (in private subnets) need a **NAT Gateway** or **NAT Instance** for outbound internet traffic.

### Firewalls

- **Network ACL (NACL)**:
   - Operates at **subnet level**.
   - **Stateless** (each request and response is evaluated separately).
   - Controls **inbound and outbound traffic** rules.
- **Security Groups (SGs)**:
   - Operate at **instance (EC2/ENI) level**.
   - **Stateful** (responses are automatically allowed).
   - Control **inbound/outbound rules** for individual instances.

### Elastic IPs

- Static **public IPv4** addresses.
- Incurs cost **if not attached to a running instance**.

### Connecting VPCs

- **VPC Peering**: Connects two VPCs **privately** if they have **non-overlapping CIDR blocks**.
   - **Non-transitive** (A↔B and B↔C doesn’t mean A↔C).

### Private Connectivity to AWS Services

- **VPC Endpoints**:
   - Allow **private access** to AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) **without internet**.
- **AWS PrivateLink**:
   - Enables **private connection** to **third-party or other VPC services** through **Network Load Balancer**.

### Network Monitoring

- **VPC Flow Logs**: capture **network traffic metadata** for analysis and troubleshooting.

### Hybrid Connectivity (On-Prem ↔ AWS)

- **Site-to-Site VPN**:
   - Secure IPsec connection over the **public internet** between **on-premises data center and AWS**.
- **Client VPN**:
   - Lets **individual users** connect securely from their **local computers** using **OpenVPN**.
- **AWS Direct Connect**:
   - Provides **dedicated private fiber connection** from **on-premises to AWS**, bypassing the internet.

### Large-Scale Connectivity

- **Transit Gateway (TGW)**:
   - Central hub for **connecting multiple VPCs, VPNs, and Direct Connect links**.
   - Simplifies management of **thousands of connections**.

### Exam Focus

- Know when to use **IGW, NAT, NACL, SG, Peering, PrivateLink, VPN, Direct Connect, and TGW**.  
- Understand **stateful vs stateless** firewalls.  
- Recognize **private vs public** access scenarios.
