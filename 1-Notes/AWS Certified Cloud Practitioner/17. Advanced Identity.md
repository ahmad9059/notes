## AWS STS (Security Token Service)
---

### Overview

- **AWS STS** is a **core AWS service** used to **create temporary, limited-privilege credentials** for accessing AWS resources.
- These credentials are **short-term** and consist of:
   - **Access Key ID**
   - **Secret Access Key**
   - **Session Token** (time-limited)

### Purpose

- Provides **temporary security credentials** instead of long-term IAM user credentials.
- Commonly used when:
   - Access must be **limited in time or scope**.
   - **Cross-account access** is required.
   - **Federated users** (from external identity systems) need AWS access.
   - **Applications or EC2 instances** assume roles to access AWS services securely.

### How It Works

1. A user or service **assumes a role** using an **STS API call** (for example, `AssumeRole`).
2. STS **returns temporary credentials** (access key, secret key, session token).
3. These credentials are used to **access AWS resources** as defined by the role’s permissions.
4. Credentials **expire automatically** after a specified duration.

### Key Use Cases

1. **Identity Federation**
   - Users managed in an **external system** (e.g., corporate directory, SSO provider) can obtain **STS tokens** to access AWS resources.
   - Allows integration with systems like **Active Directory, Google Workspace, or SAML providers**.
2. **Cross-Account Role Access**
   - Allows an IAM user in one AWS account to **assume a role in another account**.
   - Facilitates **secure sharing** of resources between AWS accounts.
3. **EC2 Instance Roles**
   - EC2 instances can assume IAM roles automatically.
   - AWS **refreshes credentials in the background** using STS to maintain temporary access tokens.

### Example

- An application running on an EC2 instance needs to access an S3 bucket.
   - The instance **assumes a role** with permissions for S3.
   - **STS** issues temporary credentials.
   - The credentials are **automatically rotated** and **expire** after a short period.

### Exam Tip

- Whenever you see a question about **temporary, limited-privilege credentials**, **cross-account access**, or **federated identity**, the correct answer often involves **AWS STS**.



## Amazon Cognito
---

### Overview

- **Amazon Cognito** provides **user identity and authentication** for **web and mobile applications**.
- It allows **millions of application users** to sign up, sign in, and access resources securely.
- **Do not create IAM users** for app users, since **IAM is only for AWS administrators and employees** who access AWS directly.

### Key Features

1. **User Management**
   - Cognito manages its **own user database** (called **User Pools**) that can store millions of users.
   - It supports **registration, authentication, and account recovery** for application users.
2. **Federated Identity**
   - Allows users to **sign in with external identity providers** such as:
       - **Facebook**
       - **Google**
       - **Apple**
       - **Amazon**
       - **SAML-based enterprise providers**
   - Users can log in via social sign-in (for example, “Login with Google”).

3. **Integration with Applications**
   - Web and mobile apps integrate directly with Cognito’s **SDK or API**.
   - Handles **token-based authentication** (JWT) and temporary AWS credentials for resource access.

### Core Components

1. **Cognito User Pools**
   - Provide **user directory** and **authentication** (sign-up/sign-in).
   - Used to **manage users directly** within Cognito.
2. **Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identities)**
   - Provide **temporary AWS credentials** to access AWS services after users authenticate.
   - Work together with **STS** to assume roles securely.

### Use Case

- When building a web or mobile app that requires **user authentication and identity management**.
- Example: An app allowing users to log in using **email/password** or **social accounts** via **Cognito**.

### Exam Tip

- For **user authentication and sign-in functionality** in **web/mobile apps**, use **Amazon Cognito**.
- For **temporary AWS credentials** for users after login, **Cognito uses STS** behind the scenes.
- **IAM users** are for internal AWS users, not application end-users.



## Microsoft Active Directory (AD)
---

### Overview

- **Microsoft Active Directory (AD)** is a **Windows-based directory service** used for managing **users, computers, printers, and permissions** in a network.
- It provides **Centralized Security Management** within an organization’s network.

### Core Concepts

- AD runs on **Windows Server** with **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.
- Stores and manages **objects**, including:
   - **User accounts**
   - **Computers**
   - **Groups**
   - **Printers**
   - **File shares**
- Uses a **Domain Controller (DC)** to authenticate users and devices.
   - Example: A corporate laptop can log in using a single username and password across all company systems connected to the same domain.

### Purpose

- Enables **single sign-on (SSO)** and centralized user management.
- Commonly used in **on-premises (corporate)** environments.
- AWS doesn’t include AD by default, but it provides ways to **integrate or extend AD** using **AWS Directory Services**.

### AWS Directory Service

#### Purpose

- Extends or connects on-premises **Active Directory** to **AWS Cloud**.

### Types of AWS Directory Services

#### 1. AWS Managed Microsoft AD

- Fully managed **Microsoft Active Directory** hosted on AWS.
- You can:
   - Create and manage **users and groups** within AWS.
   - Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
   - **Establish trust relationships** with existing on-premises AD.
- Suitable for organizations already using AD that want **hybrid cloud integration**.

#### 2. AD Connector

- A **proxy** that redirects authentication requests from AWS to **on-premises AD**.
- Users and credentials **remain on-premises** (no data is copied to AWS).
- Supports **MFA** and provides seamless access for AWS services.
- Ideal when you want to **use your existing AD without migration**.

#### 3. Simple AD

- A **standalone directory** that is **Active Directory–compatible**, but **not Microsoft AD**.
- Hosted and managed on AWS.
- Cannot be joined with an on-premises AD.
- Best for **small organizations or test environments** needing basic directory features.

### Exam Tip

- In the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam**, you only need to know that:
   - **AWS Directory Service** is used for **Active Directory integration**.
   - It supports **Microsoft Active Directory use cases** in the cloud.
   - You don’t need to memorize the details of each directory type.

### Summary Table

|Directory Type|Description|Connects to On-Prem AD|Managed by AWS|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**AWS Managed Microsoft AD**|Full Microsoft AD hosted on AWS|Yes|Yes|Hybrid cloud integration|
|**AD Connector**|Proxy to on-premises AD|Yes|Partially|Use existing AD without migration|
|**Simple AD**|Lightweight AD-compatible directory|No|Yes|Small-scale or testing|


## AWS IAM Identity Center (Successor to AWS Single Sign-On)
---

### Overview

- **IAM Identity Center** (formerly **AWS Single Sign-On**) provides **single sign-on (SSO)** access for:
   - **Multiple AWS accounts** (in an AWS Organization)
   - **Business cloud applications** (e.g., Salesforce)
   - **SAML 2.0–enabled applications**
   - **EC2 Windows instances**
- Purpose: **One login for all authorized AWS accounts and applications**.

### Key Features

1. **Centralized User Access Management**
   - Users sign in **once** and gain access to all assigned accounts or apps.
   - Reduces the need to manage **separate IAM users** for each AWS account.
   - Simplifies **multi-account management** within AWS Organizations.
2. **Identity Sources (Where User Data Lives)**
   - **Built-in Identity Store** (default in IAM Identity Center)
   - **External Identity Providers** supported, such as:
      - **Microsoft Active Directory**
      - **Okta**
      - **OneLogin**

3. **Access Portal**
   - Users log in through a **single URL**.
   - After signing in, they see a **dashboard** listing all AWS accounts and roles they can access.
   - They can launch the **AWS Management Console** for any account directly from the portal.

### Benefits

- **Simplified user management** across multiple AWS accounts.
- **Improved security** using a centralized identity system.
- **Supports SSO** for third-party and internal business applications.

- Remember that it **replaced AWS Single Sign-On** (SSO).
- Focus on:
  - **Centralized login**
  - **Integration with identity providers**
  - **Access management for multiple accounts**
