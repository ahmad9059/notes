## EC2 Storage – EBS Volumes
---

- **EBS = Elastic Block Store**
- A **network drive** you can attach to EC2 instances.
- Persists data **even after the instance is terminated** (unlike instance store).
- Think of it like a **network USB stick**.

### Key Properties

- **AZ-bound**: An EBS volume is created in a specific **Availability Zone** (e.g., `us-east-1a`) and can only be attached to EC2 instances in the same AZ.
- **One instance at a time** (at CCP level): A single EBS volume cannot be attached to multiple EC2s simultaneously.
- **Attach/detach flexibility**: Can detach from one EC2 and attach to another in the same AZ.
- **Capacity must be provisioned in advance**: Specify storage size (GB) and IOPS (I/O operations per second). You pay for provisioned capacity.
- **Performance can be increased** later by resizing or changing volume type.

### Free Tier

- **30 GB of free EBS storage per month** (General Purpose SSD or Magnetic).

### Network Latency

- Since EBS communicates over the network, expect slight **latency** compared to local storage.

### Snapshots

- **EBS Snapshots** allow moving volumes across AZs (and even regions).

### Multiple Volumes

- An EC2 instance can have **multiple EBS volumes** attached (like multiple USB sticks).
- Each EC2 instance usually has its own root volume, but you can add more.

### Unattached Volumes

- EBS volumes can exist **unattached** (not linked to any EC2) until needed.

### Delete on Termination

- **Attribute controlling EBS lifecycle when instance is terminated**:
   - **Root volume**: By default, **deleted** when EC2 instance terminates.
   - **Additional volumes**: By default, **not deleted**.
   - Can manually **enable/disable** this behavior.
- **Use case**: Keep root volume to preserve logs/data after instance termination.

## EBS Volumes (Hands-on Demo)
---

### Viewing EBS Volumes

- Each EC2 instance has a **root device** (block device, usually 8 GB by default).
- Can view attached volumes under **EC2 → Storage tab**.
- Clicking the volume opens the **EBS Volumes console**.

### Creating Additional Volumes

- Can create new EBS volumes in the **Volumes section**.
- Must specify:
   - **Volume type** (GP2, GP3, etc.).
   - **Size** (e.g., 2 GB).
   - **Availability Zone (AZ)** – must match the instance’s AZ to attach.

### Attaching Volumes

- After creation, new volumes are in **Available** state.
- Must be attached manually to an EC2 instance.
- Once attached, the EC2 instance will show **multiple block devices**.
- To use the new volume: requires **formatting & mounting** (out of scope for CCP).

### AZ Boundaries

- EBS volumes are **AZ-specific**.
- If volume is in **different AZ**, it **cannot be attached** to the instance.
- Example: Instance in `eu-west-1b` cannot attach volume created in `eu-west-1a`.

### Deleting Volumes

- Unattached volumes can be deleted instantly.
- Demonstrates **cloud flexibility**: create, attach, detach, delete quickly.

### Delete on Termination Attribute

- **Root volume**:
   - By default, **Delete on Termination = Yes**.
   - This means when the instance is terminated, the root volume is deleted.
- **Additional volumes**:
   - By default, **Delete on Termination = No**.
   - These persist after instance termination unless manually deleted.
- Behavior can be changed during **instance launch (Advanced storage settings)** or later.

### Demo Recap

- Instance terminated → **root volume deleted**.
- Additional volume remained intact.
- Confirms lifecycle behavior of **Delete on Termination**.

## EBS Snapshots
---

- **Snapshot = backup** of an EBS volume at a point in time.
- Can restore a new volume from snapshot even if original volume is deleted.
- Recommended (not required) to **detach/stop instance** before snapshot for data consistency.

### Why Snapshots?

- Restore EBS volume to previous state.
- Copy across **Availability Zones (AZs)** or **Regions**.
- Enables data transfer using AWS global infrastructure.

### How It Works

1. Take snapshot of EBS volume (optional: stop EC2 first).
2. Snapshot stored in **Region**.
3. Use snapshot to create a new EBS volume in same or another AZ.
4. Attach new volume to EC2 instance.

![|715x258](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-29.webp)
### Features

1. **EBS Snapshot Archive**
   - Move snapshots to cheaper **archive tier** (75% cheaper).
   - Restore time: **24–72 hours**.
   - Use case: long-term, low-priority backups.
2. **Recycle Bin for Snapshots**
   - Normally, deleted snapshots are gone permanently.
   - With recycle bin: recoverable for **1 day to 1 year**.
   - Protects against **accidental deletions**.

## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
---


- **AMI = Amazon Machine Image**, powers EC2 instances.
- Represents a **customized template** of an EC2 instance.
- Contains:
   - **OS** (Linux, Windows, etc.)
   - **Software packages / monitoring tools**
   - **Custom configurations**

### Benefits

- Faster **boot & configuration** (software pre-installed).
- Reusable for launching multiple identical instances.
- **Region-specific**, but can be copied across regions.

### Types of AMIs

1. **Public AMIs** – provided by AWS (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
2. **Custom AMIs** – created and maintained by you.
3. **Marketplace AMIs** – created by vendors, may be free or paid.

### AMI Lifecycle / Process

1. Launch & customize an EC2 instance.
2. Stop instance (for data integrity).
3. Create AMI (automatically creates **EBS snapshots**).
4. Launch new instances from AMI in same or another AZ/Region.

### Use Case Example

- Launch EC2 in **us-east-1a**, customize → create AMI → launch identical instance in **us-east-1b**.



## EC2 Image Builder
---

- Service to **automate creation, maintenance, validation, and testing** of:
   - **EC2 AMIs** (virtual machine images)
   - **Container images**
- Removes manual effort in customizing and updating images.

### How it Works

1. **Builder EC2 instance** created automatically.
   - Installs software (Java, CLI tools, firewalls, apps).
   - Applies OS updates and configurations.
2. AMI is **built** from the Builder instance.
3. **Test EC2 instance** launched from AMI.
   - Runs pre-defined tests (functionality, security, app health).
   - Testing step is optional.
4. AMI is **distributed** (multi-region support for global workloads).

### Key Features

- **Automation** of build → test → distribute.
- Can run **on schedule** (weekly, on package updates, or manual).
- **Free service** – only pay for:
   - EC2 instances used during build/test.
   - AMI storage and replication across regions.

### Exam Tips

- EC2 Image Builder = **automated AMI lifecycle**.
- **Builder EC2** (creates AMI) vs **Test EC2** (validates AMI).
- Supports **global distribution** of AMIs.
- Free service, but resources (EC2 + storage) are billed.

Here are **concise AWS CCP notes** from your EC2 Instance Store transcript:

---

##  EC2 Instance Store
---

- **Physical disk storage** directly attached to the host server of the EC2 instance.
- Provides **very high I/O performance** compared to EBS.
- Also called **ephemeral storage** (data does not persist).

### Key Characteristics

- **Fastest storage** option for EC2 (millions of IOPS possible).
- Data is **lost** when:
   - Instance is stopped or terminated.
   - Underlying host hardware fails.
- **Not durable**, **not persistent**.

### Use Cases

- Temporary or transient data:
   - Buffers, caches, scratch space.
   - Data that can be recomputed or retrieved.
- Not suitable for **long-term storage** → use **EBS** instead.

### Limitations & Risks

- Data loss on stop/terminate/failure.
- Responsibility for **backups and replication** is on you.

### Example

- I3 instance family → comes with **Instance Store volumes**.
- Comparison:
   - Instance Store → up to **3.3 million IOPS**.
   - gp2 EBS volume → up to **32,000 IOPS**.

### Exam Tip

- If question mentions **“very high performance, non-persistent storage”** → Answer: **EC2 Instance Store**.
- If question mentions **“durable, long-term storage”** → Answer: **EBS**.


## Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
---

- **Managed NFS (Network File System)** by AWS.
- Can be mounted to **hundreds of Linux EC2 instances simultaneously**.
- Works **across multiple AZs** in a region → highly available and scalable.

### Characteristics

- **Shared file system** → all instances see the same files.
- **Durable and highly available**.
- **Expensive** (≈ 3x gp2 EBS cost).
- **Pay-per-use** → no capacity planning needed, pay only for data stored.

### Comparison: EBS vs EFS

- **EBS**: one instance, one AZ, bound to AZ, snapshots for migration.
- **EFS**: many instances, multiple AZs, shared access, no snapshots needed.


![|715x380](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-31.webp)

### Storage Classes

1. **EFS Standard** – default, frequently accessed files.
2. **EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)** – up to **92% lower cost** for less frequently used files.
   - Uses **lifecycle policies** to move files automatically (e.g., after 60 days).
   - Transparent to applications (apps access files the same way).


![|291x413](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-32.webp)

### Exam Tips

- If question = **shared, scalable storage across AZs** → **EFS**.
- If question = **Linux only** shared file system → **EFS**.
- Remember **EFS-IA lifecycle policy** for cost optimization.


Key phrase to recall: **EFS = managed, shared, scalable NFS for Linux EC2, cross-AZ, with Standard & Infrequent Access storage classes.**


Here are **concise AWS CCP notes** from your EC2 storage **shared responsibility model** transcript:

---

## EC2 Storage – Shared Responsibility
---

### AWS Responsibilities

- **Infrastructure & durability**: Ensures data replication across hardware for **EBS/EFS**.
- **Hardware replacement**: Fixes failed disks, handles infrastructure failures.
- **Data privacy**: Prevents AWS employees from accessing your data.

### Customer Responsibilities

- **Backups & snapshots**: Set up backup plans and snapshot procedures.
- **Encryption**: Enable encryption for extra security.
- **Data management**: Responsible for all data written to the disk.
- **Instance Store usage**:
   - Data lost if instance is stopped or terminated.
   - Must plan for backup of ephemeral storage.

![|715x360](/1-Notes/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner/assets/img-33.webp)

✅ Exam takeaway:
- AWS secures the **infra & replication**, customers secure **data, backups, encryption, and usage decisions**.
